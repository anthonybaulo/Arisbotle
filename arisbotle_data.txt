["As we see that every city is a society, and every society Ed. isestablished for some good purpose; for an apparent [Bekker 1252a] goodis the spring of all human actions; it is evident that this is theprinciple upon which they are every one founded, and this is moreespecially true of that which has for its object the best possible, andis itself the most excellent, and comprehends all the rest. Now this iscalled a city, and the society thereof a political society; for thosewho think that the principles of a political, a regal, a family, anda herile government are the same are mistaken, while they suppose thateach of these differ in the numbers to whom their power extends, butnot in their constitution: so that with them a herile government is onecomposed of a very few, a domestic of more, a civil and a regal of stillmore, as if there was no difference between a large family and a smallcity, or that a regal government and a political one are the same, onlythat in the one a single person is continually at the head of publicaffairs; in the other, that each member of the state has in his turn ashare in the government, and is at one time a magistrate, at anothera private person, according to the rules of political science. But nowthis is not true, as will be evident to any one who will consider thisquestion in the most approved method. As, in an inquiry into every othersubject, it is necessary to separate the different parts of which it iscompounded, till we arrive at their first elements, which are the mostminute parts thereof; so by the same proceeding we shall acquire aknowledge of the primary parts of a city and see wherein they differfrom each other, and whether the rules of art will give us anyassistance in examining into each of these things which are mentioned.INow if in this particular science any one would attend to its originalseeds, and their first shoot, he would then as in others have thesubject perfectly before him; and perceive, in the first place, that itis requisite that those should be joined together whose species cannotexist without each other, as the male and the female, for the businessof propagation; and this not through choice, but by that natural impulsewhich acts both upon plants and animals also, for the purpose of theirleaving behind them others like themselves. It is also from naturalcauses that some beings command and others obey, that each may obtaintheir mutual safety; for a being who is endowed with a mind capableof reflection and forethought is by nature the superior and governor,whereas he whose excellence is merely corporeal is formect to be aslave; whence it follows that the different state of master [1252b] andslave is equally advantageous to both. But there is a natural differencebetween a female and a slave: for nature is not like the artistswho make the Delphic swords for the use of the poor, but for everyparticular purpose she has her separate instruments, and thus her endsare most complete, for whatsoever is employed on one subject only,brings that one to much greater perfection than when employed on many;and yet among the barbarians, a female and a slave are upon a level inthe community, the reason for which is, that amongst them there are nonequalified by nature to govern, therefore their society can be nothingbut between slaves of different sexes. For which reason the poets say,it is proper for the Greeks to govern the barbarians, as if a barbarianand a slave were by nature one. Now of these two societies the domesticis the first, and Hesiod is right when he says, \"First a house, thena wife, then an ox for the plough,\" for the poor man has always an oxbefore a household slave. That society then which nature has establishedfor daily support is the domestic, and those who compose it are calledby Charondas _homosipuoi_, and by Epimenides the Cretan _homokapnoi_;but the society of many families, which was first instituted for theirlasting, mutual advantage, is called a village, and a village is mostnaturally composed of the descendants of one family, whom some personscall homogalaktes, the children and the children's children thereof: forwhich reason cities were originally governed by kings, as the barbarianstates now are, which are composed of those who had before submitted tokingly government; for every family is governed by the elder, as are thebranches thereof, on account of their relationship thereunto, whichis what Homer says, \"Each one ruled his wife and child;\" and in thisscattered manner they formerly lived. And the opinion which universallyprevails, that the gods themselves are subject to kingly government,arises from hence, that all men formerly were, and many are so now; andas they imagined themselves to be made in the likeness of the gods, sothey supposed their manner of life must needs be the same. And when manyvillages so entirely join themselves together as in every respect toform but one society, that society is a city, and contains in itself, ifI may so speak, the end and perfection of government: first founded thatwe might live, but continued that we may live happily. For which reasonevery city must be allowed to be the work of nature, if we admit thatthe original society between male and female is; for to this as theirend all subordinate societies tend, and the end of everything is thenature of it. For what every being is in its most perfect state, thatcertainly is the nature of that being, whether it be a man, a horse, ora house: besides, whatsoever produces the final cause and the end whichwe [1253a] desire, must be best; but a government complete in itself isthat final cause and what is best. Hence it is evident that a city isa natural production, and that man is naturally a political animal, andthat whosoever is naturally and not accidentally unfit for society, mustbe either inferior or superior to man: thus the man in Homer, who isreviled for being \"without society, without law, without family.\" Sucha one must naturally be of a quarrelsome disposition, and as solitary asthe birds. The gift of speech also evidently proves that man is a moresocial animal than the bees, or any of the herding cattle: for nature,as we say, does nothing in vain, and man is the only animal who enjoysit. Voice indeed, as being the token of pleasure and pain, is impartedto others also, and thus much their nature is capable of, to perceivepleasure and pain, and to impart these sensations to others; but it isby speech that we are enabled to express what is useful for us, and whatis hurtful, and of course what is just and what is unjust: for inthis particular man differs from other animals, that he alone hasa perception of good and evil, of just and unjust, and it is aparticipation of these common sentiments which forms a family and acity. Besides, the notion of a city naturally precedes that of a familyor an individual, for the whole must necessarily be prior to the parts,for if you take away the whole man, you cannot say a foot or a handremains, unless by equivocation, as supposing a hand of stone to bemade, but that would only be a dead one; but everything is understood tobe this or that by its energic qualities and powers, so that when theseno longer remain, neither can that be said to be the same, but somethingof the same name. That a city then precedes an individual is plain,for if an individual is not in himself sufficient to compose a perfectgovernment, he is to a city as other parts are to a whole; but he thatis incapable of society, or so complete in himself as not to want it,makes no part of a city, as a beast or a god. There is then in allpersons a natural impetus to associate with each other in this manner,and he who first founded civil society was the cause of the greatestgood; for as by the completion of it man is the most excellent of allliving beings, so without law and justice he would be the worst of all,for nothing is so difficult to subdue as injustice in arms: but thesearms man is born with, namely, prudence and valour, which he may applyto the most opposite purposes, for he who abuses them will be the mostwicked, the most cruel, the most lustful, and most gluttonous beingimaginable; for justice is a political virtue, by the rules of it thestate is regulated, and these rules are the criterion of what is right.IISINCE it is now evident of what parts a city is composed, it will benecessary to treat first of family government, for every city is madeup of families, and every family [1253b] has again its separate parts ofwhich it is composed. When a family is complete, it consists of freemenand slaves; but as in every subject we should begin with examining intothe smallest parts of which it consists, and as the first and smallestparts of a family are the master and slave, the husband and wife, thefather and child, let us first inquire into these three, what each ofthem may be, and what they ought to be; that is to say, the herile, thenuptial, and the paternal. Let these then be considered as the threedistinct parts of a family: some think that the providing what isnecessary for the family is something different from the government ofit, others that this is the greatest part of it; it shall be consideredseparately; but we will first speak of a master and a slave, that wemay both understand the nature of those things which are absolutelynecessary, and also try if we can learn anything better on this subjectthan what is already known. Some persons have thought that the power ofthe master over his slave originates from his superior knowledge, andthat this knowledge is the same in the master, the magistrate, and theking, as we have already said; but others think that herile governmentis contrary to nature, and that it is the law which makes one man aslave and another free, but that in nature there is no difference; forwhich reason that power cannot be founded in justice, but in force.VSince then a subsistence is necessary in every family, the means ofprocuring it certainly makes up part of the management of a family, forwithout necessaries it is impossible to live, and to live well. Asin all arts which are brought to perfection it is necessary that theyshould have their proper instruments if they would complete their works,so is it in the art of managing a family: now of instruments some ofthem are alive, others inanimate; thus with respect to the pilot of theship, the tiller is without life, the sailor is alive; for a servantis as an instrument in many arts. Thus property is as an instrumentto living; an estate is a multitude of instruments; so a slave is ananimated instrument, but every one that can minister of himself is morevaluable than any other instrument; for if every instrument, at command,or from a preconception of its master's will, could accomplish its work(as the story goes of the statues of Daedalus; or what the poet tells usof the tripods of Vulcan, \"that they moved of their own accord into theassembly of the gods \"), the shuttle would then weave, and the lyre playof itself; nor would the architect want servants, or the [1254a] masterslaves. Now what are generally called instruments are the efficientsof something else, but possessions are what we simply use: thus with ashuttle we make something else for our use; but we only use a coat, or abed: since then making and using differ from each other in species, andthey both require their instruments, it is necessary that these shouldbe different from each other. Now life is itself what we use, and notwhat we employ as the efficient of something else; for which reason theservices of a slave are for use. A possession may be considered in thesame nature as a part of anything; now a part is not only a part ofsomething, but also is nothing else; so is a possession; therefore amaster is only the master of the slave, but no part of him; but theslave is not only the slave of the master, but nothing else but that.This fully explains what is the nature of a slave, and what are hiscapacities; for that being who by nature is nothing of himself, buttotally another's, and is a man, is a slave by nature; and that man whois the property of another, is his mere chattel, though he continues aman; but a chattel is an instrument for use, separate from the body.CHAPTER VBut whether any person is such by nature, and whether it is advantageousand just for any one to be a slave or no, or whether all slavery iscontrary to nature, shall be considered hereafter; not that it isdifficult to determine it upon general principles, or to understandit from matters of fact; for that some should govern, and others begoverned, is not only necessary but useful, and from the hour of theirbirth some are marked out for those purposes, and others for the other,and there are many species of both sorts. And the better those are whoare governed the better also is the government, as for instance of man,rather than the brute creation: for the more excellent the materialsare with which the work is finished, the more excellent certainly is thework; and wherever there is a governor and a governed, there certainlyis some work produced; for whatsoever is composed of many parts, whichjointly become one, whether conjunct or separate, evidently show themarks of governing and governed; and this is true of every living thingin all nature; nay, even in some things which partake not of life, asin music; but this probably would be a disquisition too foreign to ourpresent purpose. Every living thing in the first place is composed ofsoul and body, of these the one is by nature the governor, the other thegoverned; now if we would know what is natural, we ought to search forit in those subjects in which nature appears most perfect, and not inthose which are corrupted; we should therefore examine into a man whois most perfectly formed both in soul and body, in whom this is evident,for in the depraved and vicious the body seems [1254b] to rule ratherthan the soul, on account of their being corrupt and contrary to nature.We may then, as we affirm, perceive in an animal the first principlesof herile and political government; for the soul governs the body as themaster governs his slave; the mind governs the appetite with a politicalor a kingly power, which shows that it is both natural and advantageousthat the body should be governed by the soul, and the pathetic part bythe mind, and that part which is possessed of reason; but to have noruling power, or an improper one, is hurtful to all; and this holdstrue not only of man, but of other animals also, for tame animals arenaturally better than wild ones, and it is advantageous that both shouldbe under subjection to man; for this is productive of their commonsafety: so is it naturally with the male and the female; the one issuperior, the other inferior; the one governs, the other is governed;and the same rule must necessarily hold good with respect to allmankind. Those men therefore who are as much inferior to others as thebody is to the soul, are to be thus disposed of, as the proper use ofthem is their bodies, in which their excellence consists; and if what Ihave said be true, they are slaves by nature, and it is advantageous tothem to be always under government. He then is by nature formed a slavewho is qualified to become the chattel of another person, and on thataccount is so, and who has just reason enough to know that there is sucha faculty, without being indued with the use of it; for other animalshave no perception of reason, but are entirely guided by appetite,and indeed they vary very little in their use from each other; for theadvantage which we receive, both from slaves and tame animals, arisesfrom their bodily strength administering to our necessities; for itis the intention of nature to make the bodies of slaves and freemendifferent from each other, that the one should be robust for theirnecessary purposes, the others erect, useless indeed for what slaves areemployed in, but fit for civil life, which is divided into the duties ofwar and peace; though these rules do not always take place, for slaveshave sometimes the bodies of freemen, sometimes the souls; if then itis evident that if some bodies are as much more excellent than others asthe statues of the gods excel the human form, every one will allow thatthe inferior ought to be slaves to the superior; and if this is truewith respect to the body, it is still juster to determine in the samemanner, when we consider the soul; though it is not so easy to perceivethe beauty of [1255a] the soul as it is of the body. Since then somemen are slaves by nature, and others are freemen, it is clear that whereslavery is advantageous to any one, then it is just to make him a slave.CHAPTER VIBut it is not difficult to perceive that those who maintain the contraryopinion have some reason on their side; for a man may become a slave twodifferent ways; for he may be so by law also, and this law is a certaincompact, by which whatsoever is taken in battle is adjudged to be theproperty of the conquerors: but many persons who are conversant in lawcall in question this pretended right, and say that it would be hardthat a man should be compelled by violence to be the slave and subjectof another who had the power to compel him, and was his superior instrength; and upon this subject, even of those who are wise, some thinkone way and some another; but the cause of this doubt and variety ofopinions arises from hence, that great abilities, when accompanied withproper means, are generally able to succeed by force: for victory isalways owing to a superiority in some advantageous circumstances; sothat it seems that force never prevails but in consequence of greatabilities. But still the dispute concerning the justice of it remains;for some persons think, that justice consists in benevolence, othersthink it just that the powerful should govern: in the midst of thesecontrary opinions, there are no reasons sufficient to convince us, thatthe right of being master and governor ought not to be placed with thosewho have the greatest abilities. Some persons, entirely resting upon theright which the law gives (for that which is legal is in some respectsjust), insist upon it that slavery occasioned by war is just, not thatthey say it is wholly so, for it may happen that the principle uponwhich the wars were commenced is unjust; moreover no one will say that aman who is unworthily in slavery is therefore a slave; for if so, men ofthe noblest families might happen to be slaves, and the descendants ofslaves, if they should chance to be taken prisoners in war and sold: toavoid this difficulty they say that such persons should not be calledslaves, but barbarians only should; but when they say this, they donothing more than inquire who is a slave by nature, which was what weat first said; for we must acknowledge that there are some personswho, wherever they are, must necessarily be slaves, but others in nosituation; thus also it is with those of noble descent: it is not onlyin their own country that they are Esteemed as such, but everywhere,but the barbarians are respected on this account at home only; as ifnobility and freedom were of two sorts, the one universal, the other notso. Thus says the Helen of Theodectes:  \"Who dares reproach me with the name of slave? When from theimmortal gods, on either side, I draw my lineage.\"Those who express sentiments like these, shew only that they distinguishthe slave and the freeman, the noble and the ignoble from each otherby their virtues and their [1255b] vices; for they think it reasonable,that as a man begets a man, and a beast a beast, so from a good man, agood man should be descended; and this is what nature desires to do, butfrequently cannot accomplish it. It is evident then that this doubthas some reason in it, and that these persons are not slaves, and thosefreemen, by the appointment of nature; and also that in some instancesit is sufficiently clear, that it is advantageous to both parties forthis man to be a slave, and that to be a master, and that it is rightand just, that some should be governed, and others govern, in the mannerthat nature intended; of which sort of government is that which a masterexercises over a slave. But to govern ill is disadvantageous to both;for the same thing is useful to the part and to the whole, to the bodyand to the soul; but the slave is as it were a part of the master, as ifhe were an animated part of his body, though separate. For which reasona mutual utility and friendship may subsist between the master and theslave, I mean when they are placed by nature in that relation to eachother, for the contrary takes place amongst those who are reduced toslavery by the law, or by conquest.CHAPTER VIIIt is evident from what has been said, that a herile and a politicalgovernment are not the same, or that all governments are alike to eachother, as some affirm; for one is adapted to the nature of freemen, theother to that of slaves. Domestic government is a monarchy, for that iswhat prevails in every house; but a political state is the government offree men and equals. The master is not so called from his knowing how tomanage his slave, but because he is so; for the same reason a slave anda freeman have their respective appellations. There is also one sort ofknowledge proper for a master, another for a slave; the slave's is ofthe nature of that which was taught by a slave at Syracuse; for he fora stipulated sum instructed the boys in all the business of a householdslave, of which there are various sorts to be learnt, as the art ofcookery, and other such-like services, of which some are allotted tosome, and others to others; some employments being more honourable,others more necessary; according to the proverb, \"One slave excelsanother, one master excels another:\" in such-like things the knowledgeof a slave consists. The knowledge of the master is to be able properlyto employ his slaves, for the mastership of slaves is the employment,not the mere possession of them; not that this knowledge containsanything great or respectable; for what a slave ought to know how to do,that a master ought to know how to order; for which reason, those whohave it in their power to be free from these low attentions, employ asteward for this business, and apply themselves either to public affairsor philosophy: the knowledge of procuring what is necessary for a familyis different from that which belongs either to the master or the slave:and to do this justly must be either by war or hunting. And thus much ofthe difference between a master and a slave.CHAPTER VIII[1256a] As a slave is a particular species of property, let us byall means inquire into the nature of property in general, and theacquisition of money, according to the manner we have proposed. In thefirst place then, some one may doubt whether the getting of money isthe same thing as economy, or whether it is a part of it, or somethingsubservient to it; and if so, whether it is as the art of makingshuttles is to the art of weaving, or the art of making brass to thatof statue founding, for they are not of the same service; for the onesupplies the tools, the other the matter: by the matter I mean thesubject out of which the work is finished, as wool for the cloth andbrass for the statue. It is evident then that the getting of money isnot the same thing as economy, for the business of the one is to furnishthe means of the other to use them; and what art is there employed inthe management of a family but economy, but whether this is a part ofit, or something of a different species, is a doubt; for if it isthe business of him who is to get money to find out how riches andpossessions may be procured, and both these arise from variouscauses, we must first inquire whether the art of husbandry is part ofmoney-getting or something different, and in general, whether the sameis not true of every acquisition and every attention which relates toprovision. But as there are many sorts of provision, so are the methodsof living both of man and the brute creation very various; and as it isimpossible to live without food, the difference in that particular makesthe lives of animals so different from each other. Of beasts, somelive in herds, others separate, as is most convenient for procuringthemselves food; as some of them live upon flesh, others on fruit, andothers on whatsoever they light on, nature having so distinguishedtheir course of life, that they can very easily procure themselvessubsistence; and as the same things are not agreeable to all, but oneanimal likes one thing and another another, it follows that the livesof those beasts who live upon flesh must be different from the lives ofthose who live on fruits; so is it with men, their lives differ greatlyfrom each other; and of all these the shepherd's is the idlest, for theylive upon the flesh of tame animals, without any trouble, while they areobliged to change their habitations on account of their flocks, whichthey are compelled to follow, cultivating, as it were, a living farm.Others live exercising violence over living creatures, one pursuing thisthing, another that, these preying upon men; those who live near lakesand marshes and rivers, or the sea itself, on fishing, while others arefowlers, or hunters of wild beasts; but the greater part of mankind liveupon the produce of the earth and its cultivated fruits; and the mannerin which all those live who follow the direction of nature, and labourfor their own subsistence, is nearly the same, without ever thinkingto procure any provision by way of exchange or merchandise, such areshepherds, husband-men, [1256b] robbers, fishermen, and hunters: somejoin different employments together, and thus live very agreeably;supplying those deficiencies which were wanting to make theirsubsistence depend upon themselves only: thus, for instance, the sameperson shall be a shepherd and a robber, or a husbandman and a hunter;and so with respect to the rest, they pursue that mode of life whichnecessity points out. This provision then nature herself seems to havefurnished all animals with, as well immediately upon their first originas also when they are arrived at a state of maturity; for at the firstof these periods some of them are provided in the womb with propernourishment, which continues till that which is born can get food foritself, as is the case with worms and birds; and as to those which bringforth their young alive, they have the means for their subsistence for acertain time within themselves, namely milk. It is evident then that wemay conclude of those things that are, that plants are created for thesake of animals, and animals for the sake of men; the tame for our useand provision; the wild, at least the greater part, for our provisionalso, or for some other advantageous purpose, as furnishing us withclothes, and the like. As nature therefore makes nothing eitherimperfect or in vain, it necessarily follows that she has made all thesethings for men: for which reason what we gain in war is in a certaindegree a natural acquisition; for hunting is a part of it, which it isnecessary for us to employ against wild beasts; and those men who beingintended by nature for slavery are unwilling to submit to it, on whichoccasion such a. war is by nature just: that species of acquisition thenonly which is according to nature is part of economy; and this ought tobe at hand, or if not, immediately procured, namely, what is necessaryto be kept in store to live upon, and which are useful as well for thestate as the family. And true riches seem to consist in these; and theacquisition of those possessions which are necessary for a happy life isnot infinite; though Solon says otherwise in this verse:  \"No bounds to riches can be fixed for man;\"for they may be fixed as in other arts; for the instruments of no artwhatsoever are infinite, either in their number or their magnitude; butriches are a number of instruments in domestic and civil economy; it istherefore evident that the acquisition of certain things accordingto nature is a part both of domestic and civil economy, and for whatreason.XThere is also another species of acquisition which they [1257a]particularly call pecuniary, and with great propriety; and by thisindeed it seems that there are no bounds to riches and wealth. Now manypersons suppose, from their near relation to each other, that this isone and the same with that we have just mentioned, but it is not thesame as that, though not very different; one of these is natural, theother is not, but rather owing to some art and skill; we will enter intoa particular examination of this subject. The uses of every possessionare two, both dependent upon the thing itself, but not in the samemanner, the one supposing an inseparable connection with it, the othernot; as a shoe, for instance, which may be either worn, or exchangedfor something else, both these are the uses of the shoe; for he whoexchanges a shoe with some man who wants one, for money or provisions,uses the shoe as a shoe, but not according to the original intention,for shoes were not at first made to be exchanged. The same thing holdstrue of all other possessions; for barter, in general, had its originalbeginning in nature, some men having a surplus, others too little ofwhat was necessary for them: hence it is evident, that the sellingprovisions for money is not according to the natural use of things; forthey were obliged to use barter for those things which they wanted; butit is plain that barter could have no place in the first, that is tosay, in family society; but must have begun when the number of thosewho composed the community was enlarged: for the first of these had allthings in common; but when they came to be separated they were obligedto exchange with each other many different things which both partieswanted. Which custom of barter is still preserved amongst many barbarousnations, who procure one necessary with another, but never sellanything; as giving and receiving wine for corn and the like. Thissort of barter is not contradictory to nature, nor is it any species ofmoney-getting; but is necessary in procuring that subsistence which isso consonant thereunto. But this barter introduced the use of money, asmight be expected; for a convenient place from whence to import what youwanted, or to export what you had a surplus of, being often at a greatdistance, money necessarily made its way into commerce; for it is noteverything which is naturally most useful that is easiest of carriage;for which reason they invented something to exchange with each otherwhich they should mutually give and take, that being really valuableitself, should have the additional advantage of being of easyconveyance, for the purposes of life, as iron and silver, or anythingelse of the same nature: and this at first passed in value simplyaccording to its weight or size; but in process of time it had a certainstamp, to save the trouble of weighing, which stamp expressed its value.[1257b]Money then being established as the necessary medium of exchange,another species of money-getting soon took place, namely, by buyingand selling, at probably first in a simple manner, afterwards with moreskill and experience, where and how the greatest profits might be made.For which reason the art of money-getting seems to be chiefly conversantabout trade, and the business of it to be able to tell where thegreatest profits can be made, being the means of procuring abundanceof wealth and possessions: and thus wealth is very often supposed toconsist in the quantity of money which any one possesses, as this is themedium by which all trade is conducted and a fortune made, others againregard it as of no value, as being of none by nature, but arbitrarilymade so by compact; so that if those who use it should alter theirsentiments, it would be worth nothing, as being of no service forany necessary purpose. Besides, he who abounds in money often wantsnecessary food; and it is impossible to say that any person is in goodcircumstances when with all his possessions he may perish with hunger.Like Midas in the fable, who from his insatiable wish had everything hetouched turned into gold. For which reason others endeavour to procureother riches and other property, and rightly, for there are other richesand property in nature; and these are the proper objects of economy:while trade only procures money, not by all means, but by the exchangeof it, and for that purpose it is this which it is chiefly employedabout, for money is the first principle and the end of trade; nor arethere any bounds to be set to what is thereby acquired. Thus also thereare no limits to the art of medicine, with respect to the health whichit attempts to procure; the same also is true of all other arts; no linecan be drawn to terminate their bounds, the several professors of thembeing desirous to extend them as far as possible. (But still the meansto be employed for that purpose are limited; and these are the limitsbeyond which the art cannot proceed.) Thus in the art of acquiringriches there are no limits, for the object of that is money andpossessions; but economy has a boundary, though this has not: foracquiring riches is not the business of that, for which reason it shouldseem that some boundary should be set to riches, though we see thecontrary to this is what is practised; for all those who get riches addto their money without end; the cause of which is the near connectionof these two arts with each other, which sometimes occasions the one tochange employments with the other, as getting of money is their commonobject: for economy requires the possession of wealth, but not onits own account but with another view, to purchase things necessarytherewith; but the other procures it merely to increase it: so that somepersons are confirmed in their belief, that this is the proper objectof economy, and think that for this purpose money should be saved andhoarded up without end; the reason for which disposition is, that theyare intent upon living, but not upon living well; and this desire beingboundless in its extent, the means which they aim at for that purposeare boundless also; and those who propose to live well, often confinethat to the enjoyment of the pleasures of sense; so that as this alsoseems to depend upon what a man has, all their care is to get money,and hence arises the other cause for this art; for as this enjoyment isexcessive in its degree, they endeavour to procure means proportionateto supply it; and if they cannot do this merely by the art of dealing inmoney, they will endeavour to do it by other ways, and apply all theirpowers to a purpose they were not by nature intended for. Thus, forinstance, courage was intended to inspire fortitude, not to get moneyby; neither is this the end of the soldier's or the physician's art,but victory and health. But such persons make everything subservient tomoney-getting, as if this was the only end; and to the end everythingought to refer.We have now considered that art of money-getting which is not necessary,and have seen in what manner we became in want of it; and also thatwhich is necessary, which is different from it; for that economy whichis natural, and whose object is to provide food, is not like thisunlimited in its extent, but has its bounds.CHAPTER XWe have now determined what was before doubtful, whether or no the artof getting money is his business who is at the head of a family or astate, and though not strictly so, it is however very necessary; foras a politician does not make men, but receiving them from the hand ofnature employs them to proper purposes; thus the earth, or the sea, orsomething else ought to supply them with provisions, and this it is thebusiness of the master of the family to manage properly; for it is notthe weaver's business to make yarn, but to use it, and to distinguishwhat is good and useful from what is bad and of no service; and indeedsome one may inquire why getting money should be a part of economy whenthe art of healing is not, as it is as requisite that the family shouldbe in health as that they should eat, or have anything else which isnecessary; and as it is indeed in some particulars the business both ofthe master of the family, and he to whom the government of the stateis entrusted, to see after the health of those under their care, but inothers not, but the physician's; so also as to money; in some respectsit is the business of the master of the family, in others not, but ofthe servant; but as we have already said, it is chiefly nature's, forit is her part to supply her offspring with food; for everything findsnourishment left for it in what produced it; for which reasonthe natural riches of all men arise from fruits and animals. Nowmoney-making, as we say, being twofold, it may be applied to twopurposes, the service of the house or retail trade; of which the firstis necessary and commendable, the other justly censurable; for it hasnot its origin in [1258b] nature, but by it men gain from each other;for usury is most reasonably detested, as it is increasing our fortuneby money itself, and not employing it for the purpose it was originallyintended, namely exchange.And this is the explanation of the name (TOKOS), which means thebreeding of money. For as offspring resemble their parents, so usuryis money bred of money. Whence of all forms of money-making it is mostagainst nature.CHAPTER XIHaving already sufficiently considered the general principles of thissubject, let us now go into the practical part thereof; the one is aliberal employment for the mind, the other necessary. These things areuseful in the management of one's affairs; to be skilful in the natureof cattle, which are most profitable, and where, and how; as forinstance, what advantage will arise from keeping horses, or oxen, orsheep, or any other live stock; it is also necessary to be acquaintedwith the comparative value of these things, and which of them inparticular places are worth most; for some do better in one place, somein another. Agriculture also should be understood, and the managementof arable grounds and orchards; and also the care of bees, and fish, andbirds, from whence any profit may arise; these are the first and mostproper parts of domestic management.With respect to gaining money by exchange, the principal method of doingthis is by merchandise, which is carried on in three different ways,either by sending the commodity for sale by sea or by land, or elseselling it on the place where it grows; and these differ from each otherin this, that the one is more profitable, the other safer. The secondmethod is by usury. The third by receiving wages for work done, andthis either by being employed in some mean art, or else in mere bodilylabour. There is also a third species of improving a fortune, that issomething between this and the first; for it partly depends uponnature, partly upon exchange; the subject of which is, things that areimmediately from the earth, or their produce, which, though they bearno fruit, are yet useful, such as selling of timber and the whole art ofmetallurgy, which includes many different species, for there are varioussorts of things dug out of the earth.These we have now mentioned in general, but to enter into particularsconcerning each of them, though it might be useful to the artist, wouldbe tiresome to dwell on. Now of all the works of art, those are the mostexcellent wherein chance has the least to do, and those are the meanestwhich deprave the body, those the most servile in which bodily strengthalone is chiefly wanted, those most illiberal which require least skill;but as there are books written on these subjects by some persons, asby Chares the Panian, and Apollodorus the Lemnian, upon husbandry andplanting; and by others on other matters, [1259b] let those who haveoccasion consult them thereon; besides, every person should collecttogether whatsoever he hears occasionally mentioned, by means of whichmany of those who aimed at making a fortune have succeeded in theirintentions; for all these are useful to those who make a point ofgetting money, as in the contrivance of Thales the Milesian (which wascertainly a gainful one, but as it was his it was attributed tohis wisdom, though the method he used was a general one, and woulduniversally succeed), when they reviled him for his poverty, as if thestudy of philosophy was useless: for they say that he, perceiving by hisskill in astrology that there would be great plenty of olives that year,while it was yet winter, having got a little money, he gave earnest forall the oil works that were in Miletus and Chios, which he hired at alow price, there being no one to bid against him; but when the seasoncame for making oil, many persons wanting them, he all at once let themupon what terms he pleased; and raising a large sum of money by thatmeans, convinced them that it was easy for philosophers to be rich ifthey chose it, but that that was not what they aimed at; in this manneris Thales said to have shown his wisdom. It indeed is, as we havesaid, generally gainful for a person to contrive to make a monopoly ofanything; for which reason some cities also take this method when theywant money, and monopolise their commodities. There was a certain personin Sicily who laid out a sum of money which was deposited in his hand inbuying up all the iron from the iron merchants; so that when the dealerscame from the markets to purchase, there was no one had any to sell buthimself; and though he put no great advance upon it, yet by laying outfifty talents he made an hundred. When Dionysius heard this he permittedhim to take his money with him, but forbid him to continue any longer inSicily, as being one who contrived means for getting money inconsistentwith his affairs. This man's view and Thales's was exactly the same;both of them contrived to procure a monopoly for themselves: it isuseful also for politicians to understand these things, for many stateswant to raise money and by such means, as well as private families,nay more so; for which reason some persons who are employed in themanagement of public affairs confine themselves to this province only.CHAPTER XIIThere are then three parts of domestic government, the masters, ofwhich we have already treated, the fathers, and the husbands; now thegovernment of the wife and children should both be that of free persons,but not the [I259b] same; for the wife should be treated as a citizen ofa free state, the children should be under kingly power; for the male isby nature superior to the female, except when something happens contraryto the usual course of nature, as is the elder and perfect to theyounger and imperfect. Now in the generality of free states, thegovernors and the governed alternately change place; for an equalitywithout any preference is what nature chooses; however, when onegoverns and another is governed, she endeavours that there should be adistinction between them in forms, expressions, and honours; accordingto what Amasis said of his laver. This then should be the establishedrule between the man and the woman. The government of children shouldbe kingly; for the power of the father over the child is founded inaffection and seniority, which is a species of kingly government; forwhich reason Homer very properly calls Jupiter \"the father of gods andmen,\" who was king of both these; for nature requires that a king shouldbe of the same species with those whom he governs, though superior insome particulars, as is the case between the elder and the younger, thefather and the son.CHAPTER XIIIIt is evident then that in the due government of a family, greaterattention should be paid to the several members of it and their virtuesthan to the possessions or riches of it; and greater to the freementhan the slaves: but here some one may doubt whether there is any othervirtue in a slave than his organic services, and of higher estimationthan these, as temperance, fortitude, justice, and such-like habits, orwhether they possess only bodily qualities: each side of the questionhas its difficulties; for if they possess these virtues, wherein dothey differ from freemen? and that they do not, since they are men,and partakers of reason, is absurd. Nearly the same inquiry may be madeconcerning a woman and a child, whether these also have their propervirtues; whether a woman ought to be temperate, brave, and just, andwhether a child is temperate or no; and indeed this inquiry ought to begeneral, whether the virtues of those who, by nature, either govern orare governed, are the same or different; for if it is necessary thatboth of them should partake of the fair and good, why is it alsonecessary that, without exception, the one should govern, the otheralways be governed? for this cannot arise from their possessing thesequalities in different degrees; for to govern, and to be governed, arethings different in species, but more or less are not. And yet it iswonderful that one party ought to have them, and the other not; for ifhe who is to govern should not be temperate and just, how can he governwell? or if he is to be governed, how can he be governed well? for hewho is intemperate [1260a] and a coward will never do what he ought: itis evident then that both parties ought to be virtuous; but there is adifference between them, as there is between those who by nature commandand who by nature obey, and this originates in the soul; for in thisnature has planted the governing and submitting principle, the virtuesof which we say are different, as are those of a rational and anirrational being. It is plain then that the same principle may beextended farther, and that there are in nature a variety of things whichgovern and are governed; for a freeman is governed in a different mannerfrom a slave, a male from a female, and a man from a child: and allthese have parts of mind within them, but in a different manner. Thusa slave can have no power of determination, a woman but a weak one, achild an imperfect one. Thus also must it necessarily be with respect tomoral virtues; all must be supposed to possess them, but not in thesame manner, but as is best suited to every one's employment; on whichaccount he who is to govern ought to be perfect in moral virtue, for hisbusiness is entirely that of an architect, and reason is the architect;while others want only that portion of it which may be sufficient fortheir station; from whence it is evident, that although moral virtue iscommon to all those we have spoken of, yet the temperance of a man anda woman are not the same, nor their courage, nor their justice, thoughSocrates thought otherwise; for the courage of the man consists incommanding, the woman's in obeying; and the same is true in otherparticulars: and this will be evident to those who will examinedifferent virtues separately; for those who use general terms deceivethemselves when they say, that virtue consists in a good disposition ofmind, or doing what is right, or something of this sort. They do muchbetter who enumerate the different virtues as Georgias did, than thosewho thus define them; and as Sophocles speaks of a woman, we thinkof all persons, that their 'virtues should be applicable to theircharacters, for says he,  \"Silence is a woman's ornament,\"but it is not a man's; and as a child is incomplete, it is evident thathis virtue is not to be referred to himself in his present situation,but to that in which he will be complete, and his preceptor. In likemanner the virtue of a slave is to be referred to his master; for welaid it down as a maxim, that the use of a slave was to employ him inwhat you wanted; so that it is clear enough that few virtues are wantedin his station, only that he may not neglect his work through idlenessor fear: some person may question if what I have said is true, whethervirtue is not necessary for artificers in their calling, for they oftenthrough idleness neglect their work, but the difference between themis very great; for a slave is connected with you for life, but theartificer not so nearly: as near therefore as the artificer approachesto the situation of a slave, just so much ought he to have of thevirtues of one; for a mean artificer is to a certain point a slave; butthen a slave is one of those things which are by nature what they are,but this is not true [1260b] of a shoemaker, or any other artist. It isevident then that a slave ought to be trained to those virtues which areproper for his situation by his master; and not by him who has the powerof a master, to teach him any particular art. Those therefore are in thewrong who would deprive slaves of reason, and say that they have only tofollow their orders; for slaves want more instruction than children, andthus we determine this matter. It is necessary, I am sensible, for everyone who treats upon government, to enter particularly into the relationsof husband and wife, and of parent and child, and to show what are thevirtues of each and their respective connections with each other; whatis right and what is wrong; and how the one ought to be followed, andthe other avoided. Since then every family is part of a city, and eachof those individuals is part of a family, and the virtue of the partsought to correspond to the virtue of the whole; it is necessary, thatboth the wives and children of the community should be instructedcorrespondent to the nature thereof, if it is of consequence to thevirtue of the state, that the wives and children therein should bevirtuous, and of consequence it certainly is, for the wives are one halfof the free persons; and of the children the succeeding citizens are tobe formed. As then we have determined these points, we will leavethe rest to be spoken to in another place, as if the subject was nowfinished; and beginning again anew, first consider the sentiments ofthose who have treated of the most perfect forms of government.BOOK IISince then we propose to inquire what civil society is of all othersbest for those who have it in their power to live entirely as they wish,it is necessary to examine into the polity of those states which areallowed to be well governed; and if there should be any others whichsome persons have described, and which appear properly regulated, tonote what is right and useful in them; and when we point out whereinthey have failed, let not this be imputed to an affectation of wisdom,for it is because there are great defects in all those which are alreadyestablished, that I have been induced to undertake this work. We willbegin with that part of the subject which naturally presents itselffirst to our consideration. The members of every state must of necessityhave all things in common, or some things common, and not others,or nothing at all common. To have nothing in common is evidentlyimpossible, for society itself is one species of [1261a] community; andthe first thing necessary thereunto is a common place of habitation,namely the city, which must be one, and this every citizen must have ashare in. But in a government which is to be well founded, will it bebest to admit of a community in everything which is capable thereof, oronly in some particulars, but in others not? for it is possible that thecitizens may have their wives, and children, and goods in common, asin Plato's Commonwealth; for in that Socrates affirms that all theseparticulars ought to be so. Which then shall we prefer? the custom whichis already established, or the laws which are proposed in that treatise?INow as a community of wives is attended with many other difficulties, soneither does the cause for which he would frame his government in thismanner seem agreeable to reason, nor is it capable of producing that endwhich he has proposed, and for which he says it ought to take place; norhas he given any particular directions for putting it in practice. NowI also am willing to agree with Socrates in the principle which heproceeds upon, and admit that the city ought to be one as much aspossible; and yet it is evident that if it is contracted too much, itwill be no longer a city, for that necessarily supposes a multitude; sothat if we proceed in this manner, we shall reduce a city to a family,and a family to a single person: for we admit that a family is one in agreater degree than a city, and a single person than a family; so thatif this end could be obtained, it should never be put in practice, as itwould annihilate the city; for a city does not only consist of a largenumber of inhabitants, but there must also be different sorts; for werethey all alike, there could be no city; for a confederacy and a city aretwo different things; for a confederacy is valuable from its numbers,although all those who compose it are men of the same calling; for thisis entered into for the sake of mutual defence, as we add an additionalweight to make the scale go down. The same distinction prevails betweena city and a nation when the people are not collected into separatevillages, but live as the Arcadians. Now those things in which a cityshould be one are of different sorts, and in preserving an alternatereciprocation of power between these, the safety thereof consists (asI have already mentioned in my treatise on Morals), for amongst freemenand equals this is absolutely necessary; for all cannot govern at thesame time, but either by the year, or according to some other regulationor time, by which means every one in his turn will be in office; asif the shoemakers and carpenters should exchange occupations, and notalways be employed in the same calling. But as it is evidently better,that these should continue to exercise their respective trades; so alsoin civil society, where it is possible, it would be better that thegovernment should continue in the same hands; but where it [1261b] isnot (as nature has made all men equal, and therefore it is just, be theadministration good or bad, that all should partake of it), there it isbest to observe a rotation, and let those who are their equals by turnssubmit to those who are at that time magistrates, as they will, in theirturns, alternately be governors and governed, as if they were differentmen: by the same method different persons will execute differentoffices. From hence it is evident, that a city cannot be one in themanner that some persons propose; and that what has been said to be thegreatest good which it could enjoy, is absolutely its destruction, whichcannot be: for the good of anything is that which preserves it.For another reason also it is clear, that it is not for the bestto endeavour to make a city too much one, because a family is moresufficient in itself than a single person, a city than a family; andindeed Plato supposes that a city owes its existence to that sufficiencyin themselves which the members of it enjoy. If then this sufficiency isso desirable, the less the city is one the better.IIBut admitting that it is most advantageous for a city to be one as muchas possible, it does not seem to follow that this will take place bypermitting all at once to say this is mine, and this is not mine (thoughthis is what Socrates regards as a proof that a city is entirely one),for the word All is used in two senses; if it means each individual,what Socrates proposes will nearly take place; for each person willsay, this is his own son, and his own wife, and his own property, andof everything else that may happen to belong to him, that it is his own.But those who have their wives and children in common will not say so,but all will say so, though not as individuals; therefore, to use theword all is evidently a fallacious mode of speech; for this word issometimes used distributively, and sometimes collectively, on accountof its double meaning, and is the cause of inconclusive syllogisms inreasoning. Therefore for all persons to say the same thing was theirown, using the word all in its distributive sense, would be well, but isimpossible: in its collective sense it would by no means contribute tothe concord of the state. Besides, there would be another inconvenienceattending this proposal, for what is common to many is taken least careof; for all men regard more what is their own than what others sharewith them in, to which they pay less attention than is incumbent onevery one: let me add also, that every one is more negligent of whatanother is to see to, as well as himself, than of his own privatebusiness; as in a family one is often worse served by many servants thanby a few. Let each citizen then in the state have a thousand children,but let none of them be considered as the children of that individual,but let the relation of father and child be common to them all, and theywill all be neglected. Besides, in consequence of this, [1262a] wheneverany citizen behaved well or ill, every person, be the number what itwould, might say, this is my son, or this man's or that; and inthis manner would they speak, and thus would they doubt of the wholethousand, or of whatever number the city consisted; and it would beuncertain to whom each child belonged, and when it was born, who was totake care of it: and which do you think is better, for every one to saythis is mine, while they may apply it equally to two thousand or tenthousand; or as we say, this is mine in our present forms of government,where one man calls another his son, another calls that same personhis brother, another nephew, or some other relation, either by bloodor marriage, and first extends his care to him and his, while anotherregards him as one of the same parish and the same tribe; and it isbetter for any one to be a nephew in his private capacity than a sonafter that manner. Besides, it will be impossible to prevent somepersons from suspecting that they are brothers and sisters, fathers andmothers to each other; for, from the mutual likeness there is betweenthe sire and the offspring, they will necessarily conclude in whatrelation they stand to each other, which circumstance, we are informedby those writers who describe different parts of the world, doessometimes happen; for in Upper Africa there are wives in common whoyet deliver their children to their respective fathers, being guidedby their likeness to them. There are also some mares and cows whichnaturally bring forth their young so like the male, that we can easilydistinguish by which of them they were impregnated: such was the marecalled Just, in Pharsalia.VBesides, those who contrive this plan of community cannot easily avoidthe following evils; namely, blows, murders involuntary or voluntary,quarrels, and reproaches, all which it would be impious indeed to beguilty of towards our fathers and mothers, or those who are nearlyrelated to us; though not to those who are not connected to us by anytie of affinity: and certainly these mischiefs must necessarily happenoftener amongst those who do not know how they are connected to eachother than those who do; and when they do happen, if it is among thefirst of these, they admit of a legal expiation, but amongst the latterthat cannot be done. It is also absurd for those who promote acommunity of children to forbid those who love each other from indulgingthemselves in the last excesses of that passion, while they do notrestrain them from the passion itself, or those intercourses which areof all things most improper, between a Father and a son, a brother anda brother, and indeed the thing itself is most absurd. It is alsoridiculous to prevent this intercourse between the nearest relations,for no other reason than the violence of the pleasure, while they thinkthat the relation of father and daughter, the brother and sister, is ofno consequence at all. It seems also more advantageous for the state,that the husbandmen should have their wives and children in common thanthe military, for there will be less affection [1262b] among themin that case than when otherwise; for such persons ought to be undersubjection, that they may obey the laws, and not seek after innovations.Upon the whole, the consequences of such a law as this would be directlycontrary to those things which good laws ought to establish, and whichSocrates endeavoured to establish by his regulations concerning womenand children: for we think that friendship is the greatest good whichcan happen to any city, as nothing so much prevents seditions: and amityin a city is what Socrates commends above all things, which appearsto be, as indeed he says, the effect of friendship; as we learn fromAristophanes in the Erotics, who says, that those who love one anotherfrom the excess of that passion, desire to breathe the same soul, andfrom being two to be blended into one: from whence it would necessarilyfollow, that both or one of them must be destroyed. But now in a citywhich admits of this community, the tie of friendship must, from thatvery cause, be extremely weak, when no father can say, this is my son;or son, this is my father; for as a very little of what is sweet, beingmixed with a great deal of water is imperceptible after the mixture, somust all family connections, and the names they go by, be necessarilydisregarded in such a community, it being then by no means necessarythat the father should have any regard for him he called a son, orthe brothers for those they call brothers. There are two things whichprincipally inspire mankind with care and love of their offspring,knowing it is their own, and what ought to be the object of theiraffection, neither of which can take place in this sort of community. Asfor exchanging the children of the artificers and husbandmen with thoseof the military, and theirs reciprocally with these, it will occasiongreat confusion in whatever manner it shall be done; for of necessity,those who carry the children must know from whom they took and to whomthey gave them; and by this means those evils which I have alreadymentioned will necessarily be the more likely to happen, as blows,incestuous love, murders, and the like; for those who are given fromtheir own parents to other citizens, the military, for instance, willnot call them brothers, sons, fathers, or mothers. The same thingwould happen to those of the military who were placed among the othercitizens; so that by this means every one would be in fear how to actin consequence of consanguinity. And thus let us determine concerning acommunity of wives and children.CHAPTER VWe proceed next to consider in what manner property should be regulatedin a state which is formed after the most perfect mode of government,whether it should be common or not; for this may be considered as aseparate question from what had been determined concerning [1263a] wivesand children; I mean, whether it is better that these should be heldseparate, as they now everywhere are, or that not only possessions butalso the usufruct of them should be in common; or that the soil shouldhave a particular owner, but that the produce should be brought togetherand used as one common stock, as some nations at present do; or on thecontrary, should the soil be common, and should it also be cultivated incommon, while the produce is divided amongst the individuals for theirparticular use, which is said to be practised by some barbarians; orshall both the soil and the fruit be common? When the business ofthe husbandman devolves not on the citizen, the matter is much easiersettled; but when those labour together who have a common right ofpossession, this may occasion several difficulties; for there may notbe an equal proportion between their labour and what they consume; andthose who labour hard and have but a small proportion of the produce,will certainly complain of those who take a large share of it and do butlittle for that. Upon the whole, as a community between man and man soentire as to include everything possible, and thus to have all thingsthat man can possess in common, is very difficult, so is it particularlyso with respect to property; and this is evident from that communitywhich takes place between those who go out to settle a colony; for theyfrequently have disputes with each other upon the most common occasions,and come to blows upon trifles: we find, too, that we oftenest correctthose slaves who are generally employed in the common offices of thefamily: a community of property then has these and other inconveniencesattending it.But the manner of life which is now established, more particularly whenembellished with good morals and a system of equal laws, is far superiorto it, for it will have the advantage of both; by both I mean propertiesbeing common, and divided also; for in some respects it ought to be ina manner common, but upon the whole private: for every man's attentionbeing employed on his own particular concerns, will prevent mutualcomplaints against each other; nay, by this means industry will beincreased, as each person will labour to improve his own privateproperty; and it will then be, that from a principle of virtue they willmutually perform good offices to each other, according to the proverb,\"All things are common amongst friends;\" and in some cities there aretraces of this custom to be seen, so that it is not impracticable, andparticularly in those which are best governed; some things are by thismeans in a manner common, and others might be so; for there, everyperson enjoying his own private property, some things he assists hisfriend with, others are considered as in common; as in Lacedaemon, wherethey use each other's slaves, as if they were, so to speak, their own,as they do their horses and dogs, or even any provision they may want ina journey.It is evident then that it is best to have property private, but to makethe use of it common; but how the citizens are to be brought to it isthe particular [1263b] business of the legislator. And also with respectto pleasure, it is unspeakable how advantageous it is, that a man shouldthink he has something which he may call his own; for it is by no meansto no purpose, that each person should have an affection for himself,for that is natural, and yet to be a self-lover is justly censured; forwe mean by that, not one that simply loves himself, but one that loveshimself more than he ought; in like manner we blame a money-lover,and yet both money and self is what all men love. Besides, it is verypleasing to us to oblige and assist our friends and companions, as wellas those whom we are connected with by the rights of hospitality; andthis cannot be done without the establishment of private property, whichcannot take place with those who make a city too much one; besides, theyprevent every opportunity of exercising two principal virtues, modestyand liberality. Modesty with respect to the female sex, for this virtuerequires you to abstain from her who is another's; liberality, whichdepends upon private property, for without that no one can appearliberal, or do any generous action; for liberality consists in impartingto others what is our own.This system of polity does indeed recommend itself by its goodappearance and specious pretences to humanity; and when first proposedto any one, must give him great pleasure, as he will conclude it to bea wonderful bond of friendship, connecting all to all; particularlywhen any one censures the evils which are now to be found in society,as arising from properties not being common, I mean the disputes whichhappen between man and man, upon their different contracts with eachother; those judgments which are passed in court in consequence offraud, and perjury, and flattering the rich, none of which arise fromproperties being private, but from the vices of mankind. Besides,those who live in one general community, and have all things in common,oftener dispute with each other than those who have their propertyseparate; from the very small number indeed of those who have theirproperty in common, compared with those where it is appropriated,the instances of their quarrels are but few. It is also but right tomention, not only the inconveniences they are preserved from who live ina communion of goods, but also the advantages they are deprived of; forwhen the whole comes to be considered, this manner of life will be foundimpracticable.We must suppose, then, that Socrates's mistake arose from the principlehe set out with being false; we admit, indeed, that both a family and acity ought to be one in some particulars, but not entirely; for thereis a point beyond which if a city proceeds in reducing itself to one, itwill be no longer a city.There is also another point at which it will still continue to be acity, but it will approach so near to not being one, that it will beworse than none; as if any one should reduce the voices of those whosing in concert to one, or a verse to a foot. But the people ought tobe made one, and a community, as I have already said, by education;as property at Lacedaemon, and their public tables at Crete, were madecommon by their legislators. But yet, whosoever shall introduce anyeducation, and think thereby to make his city excellent and respectable,will be absurd, while he expects to form it by such regulations, and notby manners, philosophy, and laws. And whoever [1264a] would establisha government upon a community of goods, ought to know that he shouldconsult the experience of many years, which would plainly enough informhim whether such a scheme is useful; for almost all things have alreadybeen found out, but some have been neglected, and others which have beenknown have not been put in practice. But this would be most evident, ifany one could see such a government really established: for it would beimpossible to frame such a city without dividing and separating it intoits distinct parts, as public tables, wards, and tribes; so that herethe laws will do nothing more than forbid the military to engagein agriculture, which is what the Lacedaemonians are at presentendeavouring to do.Nor has Socrates told us (nor is it easy to say) what plan of governmentshould be pursued with respect to the individuals in the state wherethere is a community of goods established; for though the majorityof his citizens will in general consist of a multitude of persons ofdifferent occupations, of those he has determined nothing; whether theproperty of the husbandman ought to be in common, or whether each personshould have his share to himself; and also, whether their wives andchildren ought to be in common: for if all things are to be alike commonto all, where will be the difference between them and the military, orwhat would they get by submitting to their government? and upon whatprinciples would they do it, unless they should establish the wisepractice of the Cretans? for they, allowing everything else to theirslaves, forbid them only gymnastic exercises and the use of arms. And ifthey are not, but these should be in the same situation with respect totheir property which they are in other cities, what sort of a communitywill there be? in one city there must of necessity be two, and thosecontrary to each other; for he makes the military the guardians of thestate, and the husbandman, artisans, and others, citizens; and all thosequarrels, accusations, and things of the like sort, which he says arethe bane of other cities, will be found in his also: notwithstandingSocrates says they will not want many laws in consequence of theireducation, but such only as may be necessary for regulating the streets,the markets, and the like, while at the same time it is the education ofthe military only that he has taken any care of. Besides, he makes thehusbandmen masters of property upon paying a tribute; but this wouldbe likely to make them far more troublesome and high-spirited than theHelots, the Penestise, or the slaves which others employ; nor has heever determined whether it is necessary to give any attention to themin these particulars, nor thought of what is connected therewith,their polity, their education, their laws; besides, it is of no littleconsequence, nor is it easy to determine, how these should be framed soas to preserve the community of the military.Besides, if he makes the wives common, while the property [1264b]continues separate, who shall manage the domestic concerns with the samecare which the man bestows upon his fields? nor will the inconveniencebe remedied by making property as well as wives common; and it is absurdto draw a comparison from the brute creation, and say, that the sameprinciple should regulate the connection of a man and a woman whichregulates theirs amongst whom there is no family association.It is also very hazardous to settle the magistracy as Socrates hasdone; for he would have persons of the same rank always in office, whichbecomes the cause of sedition even amongst those who are of no account,but more particularly amongst those who are of a courageous and warlikedisposition; it is indeed evidently necessary that he should frame hiscommunity in this manner; for that golden particle which God has mixedup in the soul of man flies not from one to the other, but alwayscontinues with the same; for he says, that some of our species havegold, and others silver, blended in their composition from the moment oftheir birth: but those who are to be husbandmen and artists, brass andiron; besides, though he deprives the military of happiness, he says,that the legislator ought to make all the citizens happy; but itis impossible that the whole city can be happy, without all, or thegreater, or some part of it be happy. For happiness is not likethat numerical equality which arises from certain numbers when addedtogether, although neither of them may separately contain it; forhappiness cannot be thus added together, but must exist in everyindividual, as some properties belong to every integral; and if themilitary are not happy, who else are so? for the artisans are not, northe multitude of those who are employed in inferior offices. The statewhich Socrates has described has all these defects, and others which arenot of less consequence.CHAPTER VIIt is also nearly the same in the treatise upon Laws which was writafterwards, for which reason it will be proper in this place to considerbriefly what he has there said upon government, for Socrates hasthoroughly settled but very few parts of it; as for instance, in whatmanner the community of wives and children ought to be regulated, howproperty should be established, and government conducted.Now he divides the inhabitants into two parts, husbandmen and soldiers,and from these he select a third part who are to be senators and governthe city; but he has not said whether or no the husbandman and artificershall have any or what share in the government, or whether they shallhave arms, and join with the others in war, or not. He thinks alsothat the women ought to go to war, and have the same education as thesoldiers; as to other particulars, he has filled his treatise withmatter foreign to the purpose; and with respect to education, he hasonly said what that of the guards ought to be.[1265a] As to his book of Laws, laws are the principal thing which thatcontains, for he has there said but little concerning government; andthis government, which he was so desirous of framing in such a manner asto impart to its members a more entire community of goods than is to befound in other cities, he almost brings round again to be the sameas that other government which he had first proposed; for except thecommunity of wives and goods, he has framed both his governments alike,for the education of the citizens is to be the same in both; they are inboth to live without any servile employ, and their common tables are tobe the same, excepting that in that he says the women should have commontables, and that there should be a thousand men-at-arms, in this, thatthere should be five thousand.All the discourses of Socrates are masterly, noble, new, andinquisitive; but that they are all true it may probably be too muchto say. For now with respect to the number just spoken of, it must beacknowledged that he would want the country of Babylonia for them, orsome one like it, of an immeasurable extent, to support five thousandidle persons, besides a much greater number of women and servants. Everyone, it is true, may frame an hypothesis as he pleases, but yet it oughtto be possible. It has been said, that a legislator should have twothings in view when he frames his laws, the country and the people. Hewill also do well, if he has some regard to the neighbouring states, ifhe intends that his community should maintain any political intercoursewith them, for it is not only necessary that they should understand thatpractice of war which is adapted to their own country, but to othersalso; for admitting that any one chooses not this life either inpublic or private, yet there is not the less occasion for their beingformidable to their enemies, not only when they invade their country,but also when they retire out of it.It may also be considered whether the quantity of each person's propertymay not be settled in a different manner from what he has done it in,by making it more determinate; for he says, that every one ought to haveenough whereon to live moderately, as if any one had said to live well,which is the most comprehensive expression. Besides, a man may livemoderately and miserably at the same time; he had therefore betterhave proposed, that they should live both moderately and liberally;for unless these two conspire, luxury will come in on the one hand, orwretchedness on the other, since these two modes of living are the onlyones applicable to the employment of our substance; for we cannot saywith respect to a man's fortune, that he is mild or courageous, but wemay say that he is prudent and liberal, which are the only qualitiesconnected therewith.It is also absurd to render property equal, and not to provide forthe increasing number of the citizens; but to leave that circumstanceuncertain, as if it would regulate itself according to the number ofwomen who [1265b] should happen to be childless, let that be what itwould because this seems to take place in other cities; but the casewould not be the same in such a state which he proposes and those whichnow actually unite; for in these no one actually wants, as the propertyis divided amongst the whole community, be their numbers what they will;but as it could not then be divided, the supernumeraries, whether theywere many or few, would have nothing at all. But it is more necessarythan even to regulate property, to take care that the increase of thepeople should not exceed a certain number; and in determining that,to take into consideration those children who will die, and also thosewomen who will be barren; and to neglect this, as is done in severalcities, is to bring certain poverty on the citizens; and poverty is thecause of sedition and evil. Now Phidon the Corinthian, one of the oldestlegislators, thought the families and the number of the citizens shouldcontinue the same; although it should happen that all should haveallotments at the first, disproportionate to their numbers.In Plato's Laws it is however different; we shall mention hereafter whatwe think would be best in these particulars. He has also neglected inthat treatise to point out how the governors are to be distinguishedfrom the governed; for he says, that as of one sort of wool the warpought to be made, and of another the woof, so ought some to govern, andothers to be governed. But since he admits, that all their property maybe increased fivefold, why should he not allow the same increase to thecountry? he ought also to consider whether his allotment of the houseswill be useful to the community, for he appoints two houses to eachperson, separate from each other; but it is inconvenient for a personto inhabit two houses. Now he is desirous to have his whole plan ofgovernment neither a democracy nor an oligarchy, but something betweenboth, which he calls a polity, for it is to be composed of men-at-arms.If Plato intended to frame a state in which more than in any othereverything should be common, he has certainly given it a right name;but if he intended it to be the next in perfection to that which he hadalready framed, it is not so; for perhaps some persons will give thepreference to the Lacedaemonian form of government, or some other whichmay more completely have attained to the aristocratic form.Some persons say, that the most perfect government should be composedof all others blended together, for which reason they commend thatof Lacedaemon; for they say, that this is composed of an oligarchy,a monarchy, and a democracy, their kings representing the monarchicalpart, the senate the oligarchical; and, that in the ephori may be foundthe democratical, as these are taken from the people. But some say, thatin the ephori is absolute power, and that it is their common meal anddaily course of life, in which the democratical form is represented.It is also said in this treatise of [1266a] Laws, that the best form ofgovernment must, be one composed of a democracy and a tyranny; thoughsuch a mixture no one else would ever allow to be any government at all,or if it is, the worst possible; those propose what is much better whoblend many governments together; for the most perfect is that which isformed of many parts. But now in this government of Plato's there areno traces of a monarchy, only of an oligarchy and democracy; though heseems to choose that it should rather incline to an oligarchy, as isevident from the appointment of the magistrates; for to choose them bylot is common to both; but that a man of fortune must necessarily be amember of the assembly, or to elect the magistrates, or take part in themanagement of public affairs, while others are passed over, makes thestate incline to an oligarchy; as does the endeavouring that thegreater part of the rich may be in office, and that the rank of theirappointments may correspond with their fortunes.The same principle prevails also in the choice of their senate; themanner of electing which is favourable also to an oligarchy; for allare obliged to vote for those who are senators of the first class,afterwards they vote for the same number out of the second, and then outof the third; but this compulsion to vote at the election of senatorsdoes not extend to the third and fourth classes and the first and secondclass only are obliged to vote for the fourth. By this means he sayshe shall necessarily have an equal number of each rank, but he ismistaken--for the majority will always consist of those of the firstrank, and the most considerable people; and for this reason, thatmany of the commonalty not being obliged to it, will not attend theelections. From hence it is evident, that such a state will not consistof a democracy and a monarchy, and this will be further proved bywhat we shall say when we come particularly to consider this form ofgovernment.There will also great danger arise from the manner of electing thesenate, when those who are elected themselves are afterwards to electothers; for by this means, if a certain number choose to combinetogether, though not very considerable, the election will always fallaccording to their pleasure. Such are the things which Plato proposesconcerning government in his book of Laws.CHAPTER VIIThere are also some other forms of government, which have been proposedeither by private persons, or philosophers, or politicians, all of whichcome much nearer to those which have been really established, or nowexist, than these two of Plato's; for neither have they introduced theinnovation of a community of wives and children, and public tables forthe women, but have been contented to set out with establishing suchrules as are absolutely necessary.There are some persons who think, that the first object of governmentshould be to regulate well everything relating to private property;for they say, that a neglect herein is the source of all seditionswhatsoever. For this reason, Phaleas the Chalcedonian first proposed,that the fortunes of the citizens should be equal, which he thought wasnot difficult to accomplish when a community was first settled, butthat it was a work of greater difficulty in one that had been longestablished; but yet that it might be effected, and an equality ofcircumstances introduced by these means, that the rich should givemarriage portions, but never receive any, while the poor should alwaysreceive, but never give.But Plato, in his treatise of Laws, thinks that a difference incircumstances should be permitted to a certain degree; but that nocitizen should be allowed to possess more than five times as much as thelowest census, as we have already mentioned. But legislators whowould establish this principle are apt to overlook what they ought toconsider; that while they regulate the quantity of provisions which eachindividual shall possess, they ought also to regulate the number of hischildren; for if these exceed the allotted quantity of provision, thelaw must necessarily be repealed; and yet, in spite of the repeal, itwill have the bad effect of reducing many from wealth to poverty, sodifficult is it for innovators not to fall into such mistakes. That anequality of goods was in some degree serviceable to strengthen the bandsof society, seems to have been known to some of the ancients; for Solonmade a law, as did some others also, to restrain persons from possessingas much land as they pleased. And upon the same principle there are lawswhich forbid men to sell their property, as among the Locrians, unlessthey can prove that some notorious misfortune has befallen them. Theywere also to preserve their ancient patrimony, which custom being brokenthrough by the Leucadians, made their government too democratic; forby that means it was no longer necessary to be possessed of a certainfortune to be qualified to be a magistrate. But if an equality of goodsis established, this may be either too much, when it enables the peopleto live luxuriously, or too little, when it obliges them to livehard. Hence it is evident, that it is not proper for the legislatorto establish an equality of circumstances, but to fix a proper medium.Besides, if any one should regulate the division of property in such amanner that there should be a moderate sufficiency for all, it wouldbe of no use; for it is of more consequence that the citizen shouldentertain a similarity of sentiments than an equality of circumstances;but this can never be attained unless they are properly educated underthe direction of the law. But probably Phaleas may say, that this inwhat he himself mentions; for he both proposes a equality of propertyand one plan of education in his city. But he should have saidparticularly what education he intended, nor is it of any service tohave this to much one; for this education may be one, and yet such aswill make the citizens over-greedy, to grasp after honours, or riches,or both. Besides, not only an inequality of possessions, but alsoof honours, will occasion [1267a] seditions, but this upon contrarygrounds; for the vulgar will be seditious if there be an inequality ofgoods, by those of more elevated sentiments, if there is an equality ofhonours.  \"When good and bad do equal honours share.\"For men are not guilty of crimes for necessaries only (for which hethinks an equality of goods would be a sufficient remedy, as they wouldthen have no occasion to steal cold or hunger), but that they may enjoywhat they desire, and not wish for it in vain; for if their desire extendbeyond the common necessaries of life, they were be wicked to gratifythem; and not only so, but if their wishes point that way, they will dothe same to enjoy those pleasures which are free from the alloy of pain.What remedy then shall we find for these three disorders? And first,to prevent stealing from necessity, let every one be supplied with amoderate subsistence, which may make the addition of his own industrynecessary; second to prevent stealing to procure the luxuries of life,temperance be enjoined; and thirdly, let those who wish for pleasure initself seek for it only in philosophy, all others want the assistance ofmen.Since then men are guilty of the greatest crimes from ambition, and notfrom necessity, no one, for instance aims at being a tyrant to keep himfrom the cold, hence great honour is due to him who kills not a thief,but tyrant; so that polity which Phaleas establishes would only besalutary to prevent little crimes. He has also been very desirous toestablish such rules as will conduce to perfect the internal policy ofhis state, and he ought also to have done the same with respect toits neighbours and all foreign nations; for the considerations of themilitary establishment should take place in planning every government,that it may not be unprovided in case of a war, of which he has saidnothing; so also with respect to property, it ought not only to beadapted to the exigencies of the state, but also to such dangers as mayarise from without.Thus it should not be so much as to tempt those who are near, and morepowerful to invade it, while those who possess it are not able to driveout the invaders, nor so little as that the state should not be able togo to war with those who are quite equal to itself, and of this he hasdetermined nothing; it must indeed be allowed that it is advantageous toa community to be rather rich than poor; probably the proper boundary isthis, not to possess enough to make it worth while for a more powerfulneighbour to attack you, any more than he would those who had not somuch as yourself; thus when Autophradatus proposed to besiege Atarneus,Eubulus advised him to consider what time it would require to take thecity, and then would have him determine whether it would answer, forthat he should choose, if it would even take less than he proposed,to quit the place; his saying this made Autophradatus reflect upon thebusiness and give over the siege. There is, indeed, some advantage in anequality of goods amongst the citizens to prevent seditions; and yet,to say truth, no very great one; for men of great abilities will stomachtheir being put upon a level with the rest of the community. Forwhich reason they will very often appear ready for every commotion andsedition; for the wickedness of mankind is insatiable. For thoughat first two oboli might be sufficient, yet when once it is becomecustomary, they continually want something more, until they set nolimits to their expectations; for it is the nature of our desires to beboundless, and many live only to gratify them. But for this purpose thefirst object is, not so much to establish an equality of fortune, asto prevent those who are of a good disposition from desiring more thantheir own, and those who are of a bad one from being able to acquire it;and this may be done if they are kept in an inferior station, and notexposed to injustice. Nor has he treated well the equality of goods, forhe has extended his regulation only to land; whereas a man's substanceconsists not only in this, but also in slaves, cattle, money, and allthat variety of things which fall under the name of chattels; now theremust be either an equality established in all these, or some certainrule, or they must be left entirely at large. It appears too by hislaws, that he intends to establish only a small state, as all theartificers are to belong to the public, and add nothing to thecomplement of citizens; but if all those who are to be employed inpublic works are to be the slaves of the public, it should be donein the same manner as it is at Epidamnum, and as Diophantus formerlyregulated it at Athens. From these particulars any one may nearly judgewhether Phaleas's community is well or ill established.CHAPTER VIIIHippodamus, the son of Euruphon a Milesian, contrived the art of layingout towns, and separated the Pireus. This man was in other respectstoo eager after notice, and seemed to many to live in a very affectedmanner, with his flowing locks and his expensive ornaments, and a coarsewarm vest which he wore, not only in the winter, but also in thehot weather. As he was very desirous of the character of a universalscholar, he was the first who, not being actually engaged in themanagement of public affairs, sat himself to inquire what sort ofgovernment was best; and he planned a state, consisting of ten thousandpersons, divided into three parts, one consisting of artisans, anotherof husbandmen, and the third of soldiers; he also divided the lands intothree parts, and allotted one to sacred purposes, another to the public,and the third to individuals. The first of these was to supply what wasnecessary for the established worship of the gods; the second was tobe allotted to the support of the soldiery; and the third was to bethe property of the husbandman. He thought also that there need only bethree sorts of laws, corresponding to the three sorts of actions whichcan be brought, namely, for assault, trespasses, or death. He orderedalso that there should be a particular court of appeal, into whichall causes might be removed which were supposed to have been unjustlydetermined elsewhere; which court should be composed of old men chosenfor that purpose. He thought also [1268a] that they should not passsentence by votes; but that every one should bring with him a tablet, onwhich he should write, that he found the party guilty, if it was so, butif not, he should bring a plain tablet; but if he acquitted him of onepart of the indictment but not of the other, he should express thatalso on the tablet; for he disapproved of that general custom alreadyestablished, as it obliges the judges to be guilty of perjury if theydetermined positively either on the one side or the other. He also madea law, that those should be rewarded who found out anything for the goodof the city, and that the children of those who fell in battle should beeducated at the public expense; which law had never been proposed by anyother legislator, though it is at present in use at Athens as well as inother cities, he would have the magistrates chosen out of the peoplein general, by whom he meant the three parts before spoken of; and thatthose who were so elected should be the particular guardians of whatbelonged to the public, to strangers, and to orphans.These are the principal parts and most worthy of notice in Hippodamus'splan. But some persons might doubt the propriety of his division of thecitizens into three parts; for the artisans, the husbandmen, and thesoldiers are to compose one community, where the husbandmen are to haveno arms, and the artisans neither arms nor land, which would in a mannerrender them slaves to the soldiery. It is also impossible that the wholecommunity should partake of all the honourable employments in it--forthe generals and the guardians of the state must necessarily beappointed out of the soldiery, and indeed the most honourablemagistrates; but as the two other parts will not have their share in thegovernment, how can they be expected to have any affection for it? Butit is necessary that the soldiery should be superior to the other twoparts, and this superiority will not be easily gained without they arevery numerous; and if they are so, why should the community consistof any other members? why should any others have a right to elect themagistrates? Besides, of what use are the husbandmen to this community?Artisans, 'tis true, are necessary, for these every city wants, and theycan live upon their business. If the husbandmen indeed furnished thesoldiers with provisions, they would be properly part of the community;but these are supposed to have their private property, and to cultivateit for their own use. Moreover, if the soldiers themselves are tocultivate that common land which is appropriated for their support,there will be no distinction between the soldier and the husbandman,which the legislator intended there should be; and if there should beany others who are to cultivate the private property of the husbandmanand the common lands of the military, there will be a fourth order inthe state which will have no share in it, and always entertain hostilesentiments towards it. If any one should propose that the same personsshould cultivate their own lands and the public ones also, then therewould be a deficiency [1268b] of provisions to supply two families,as the lands would not immediately yield enough for themselves and thesoldiers also; and all these things would occasion great confusion.Nor do I approve of his method of determining causes, when he wouldhave the judge split the case which comes simply before him; and thus,instead of being a judge, become an arbitrator. Now when any matteris brought to arbitration, it is customary for many persons to confertogether upon the business that is before them; but when a cause isbrought before judges it is not so; and many legislators take carethat the judges shall not have it in their power to communicate theirsentiments to each other. Besides, what can prevent confusion on thebench when one judge thinks a fine should be different from what anotherhas set it at; one proposing twenty minae, another ten, or be it moreor less, another four, and another five; and it is evident, that in thismanner they will differ from each other, while some will give the wholedamages sued for, and others nothing; in this situation, how shall theirdeterminations be settled? Besides, a judge cannot be obliged to perjurehimself who simply acquits or condemns, if the action is fairly andjustly brought; for he who acquits the party does not say that he oughtnot to pay any fine at all, but that he ought not to pay a fine oftwenty minae. But he that condemns him is guilty of perjury if hesentences him to pay twenty minae while he believes the damages oughtnot to be so much.Now with respect to these honours which he proposes to bestow on thosewho can give any information useful to the community, this, though verypleasing in speculation, is what the legislator should not settle, forit would encourage informers, and probably occasion commotions in thestate. And this proposal of his gives rise also to further conjecturesand inquiries; for some persons have doubted whether it is useful orhurtful to alter the established law of any country, if even for thebetter; for which reason one cannot immediately determine upon what hehere says, whether it is advantageous to alter the law or not. We know,indeed, that it is possible to propose to new model both the laws andgovernment as a common good; and since we have mentioned this subject,it may be very proper to enter into a few particulars concerning it, forit contains some difficulties, as I have already said, and it may appearbetter to alter them, since it has been found useful in other sciences.Thus the science of physic is extended beyond its ancient bounds; so isthe gymnastic, and indeed all other arts and powers; so that one may layit down for certain that the same thing will necessarily hold good inthe art of government. And it may also be affirmed, that experienceitself gives a proof of this; for the ancient laws are too simple andbarbarous; which allowed the Greeks to wear swords in the city, and tobuy their wives of each [1269a]. other. And indeed all the remains ofold laws which we have are very simple; for instance, a law in Cumarelative to murder. If any person who prosecutes another for murder canproduce a certain number of witnesses to it of his own relations, theaccused person shall be held guilty. Upon the whole, all persons oughtto endeavour to follow what is right, and not what is established; andit is probable that the first men, whether they sprung out of the earth,or were saved from some general calamity, had very little understandingor knowledge, as is affirmed of these aborigines; so that it would beabsurd to continue in the practice of their rules. Nor is it, moreover,right to permit written laws always to remain without alteration; foras in all other sciences, so in politics, it is impossible to expresseverything in writing with perfect exactness; for when we commitanything to writing we must use general terms, but in every action thereis something particular to itself, which these may not comprehend; fromwhence it is evident, that certain laws will at certain times admit ofalterations. But if we consider this matter in another point of view, itwill appear to require great caution; for when the advantage proposed istrifling, as the accustoming the people easily to abolish their lawsis of bad consequence, it is evidently better to pass over some faultswhich either the legislator or the magistrates may have committed; forthe alterations will not be of so much service as a habit of disobeyingthe magistrates will be of disservice. Besides, the instance broughtfrom the arts is fallacious; for it is not the same thing to alter theone as the other. For a law derives all its strength from custom, andthis requires long time to establish; so that, to make it an easy matterto pass from the established laws to other new ones, is to weaken thepower of laws. Besides, here is another question; if the laws are to bealtered, are they all to be altered, and in every government or not, andwhether at the pleasure of one person or many? all which particularswill make a great difference; for which reason we will at present dropthe inquiry, to pursue it at some other time.XThere are two considerations which offer themselves with respect to thegovernment established at Lacedaemon and Crete, and indeed in almost allother states whatsoever; one is whether their laws do or do not promotethe best establishment possible? the other is whether there is anything,if we consider either the principles upon which it is founded or theexecutive part of it, which prevents the form of government that theyhad proposed to follow from being observed; now it is allowed that inevery well-regulated state the members of it should be free from servilelabour; but in what manner this shall be effected is not so easy todetermine; for the Penestse have very often attacked the Thessalians,and the Helots the Lacedaemonians, for they in a manner continuallywatch an opportunity for some misfortune befalling them. But no suchthing has ever happened to the Cretans; the [1269b] reason for whichprobably is, that although they are engaged in frequent wars with theneighbouring cities, yet none of these would enter into an alliance withthe revolters, as it would be disadvantageous for them, who themselvesalso have their villains. But now there is perpetual enmity between theLacedaemonians and all their neighbours, the Argives, the Messenians,and the Arcadians. Their slaves also first revolted from the Thessalianswhile they were engaged in wars with their neighbours the Acheans, thePerrabeans, and the Magnesians. It seems to me indeed, if nothing else,yet something very troublesome to keep upon proper terms with them;for if you are remiss in your discipline they grow insolent, and thinkthemselves upon an equality with their masters; and if they are hardlyused they are continually plotting against you and hate you. It isevident, then, that those who employ slaves have not as yet hit upon theright way of managing them.As to the indulging of women in any particular liberties, it is hurtfulto the end of government and the prosperity of the city; for as a manand his wife are the two parts of a family, if we suppose a city to bedivided into two parts, we must allow that the number of men and womenwill be equal.In whatever city then the women are not under good regulations, we mustlook upon one half of it as not under the restraint of law, as itthere happened; for the legislator, desiring to make his whole citya collection of warriors with respect to the men, he most evidentlyaccomplished his design; but in the meantime the women were quiteneglected, for they live without restraint in every improper indulgenceand luxury. So that in such a state riches will necessarily be ingeneral esteem, particularly if the men are governed by their wives,which has been the case with many a brave and warlike people exceptthe Celts, and those other nations, if there are any such, who openlypractise pederasty. And the first mythologists seem not improperly tohave joined Mars and Venus together; for all nations of this characterare greatly addicted either to the love of women or of boys, for whichreason it was thus at Lacedaemon; and many things in their state weredone by the authority of the women. For what is the difference, if thepower is in the hands of the women, or in the hands of those whom theythemselves govern? it must turn to the same account. As this boldness ofthe women can be of no use in any common occurrences, if it was ever so,it must be in war; but even here we find that the Lacedaemonian womenwere of the greatest disservice, as was proved at the time of the Thebaninvasion, when they were of no use at all, as they are in other cities,but made more disturbance than even the enemy.The origin of this indulgence which the Lacedaemonian women enjoy iseasily accounted for, from the long time the men were absent from homeupon foreign expeditions [1270a] against the Argives, and afterwards theArcadians and Messenians, so that, when these wars were at an end, theirmilitary life, in which there is no little virtue, prepared them to obeythe precepts of their law-giver; but we are told, that when Lycurgusendeavoured also to reduce the women to an obedience to his laws, upontheir refusal he declined it. It may indeed be said that the women werethe causes of these things, and of course all the fault was theirs. Butwe are not now considering where the fault lies, or where it does notlie, but what is right and what is wrong; and when the manners of thewomen are not well regulated, as I have already said, it must not onlyoccasion faults which are disgraceful to the state, but also increasethe love of money. In the next place, fault may be found with hisunequal division of property, for some will have far too much, otherstoo little; by which means the land will come into few hands, whichbusiness is badly regulated by his laws. For he made it infamous for anyone either to buy or sell their possessions, in which he did right; buthe permitted any one that chose it to give them away, or bequeath them,although nearly the same consequences will arise from one practice asfrom the other. It is supposed that near two parts in five of the wholecountry is the property of women, owing to their being so often soleheirs, and having such large fortunes in marriage; though it wouldbe better to allow them none, or a little, or a certain regulatedproportion. Now every one is permitted to make a woman his heir if hepleases; and if he dies intestate, he who succeeds as heir at law givesit to whom he pleases. From whence it happens that although the countryis able to support fifteen hundred horse and thirty thousand foot, thenumber does not amount to one thousand.And from these facts it is evident, that this particular is badlyregulated; for the city could not support one shock, but was ruined forwant of men. They say, that during the reigns of their ancient kingsthey used to present foreigners with the freedom of their city, toprevent there being a want of men while they carried on long wars; it isalso affirmed that the number of Spartans was formerly ten thousand; butbe that as it will, an equality of property conduces much to increasethe number of the people. The law, too, which he made to encouragepopulation was by no means calculated to correct this inequality;for being willing that the Spartans should be as numerous as [1270b]possible, to make them desirous of having large families he ordered thathe who had three children should be excused the night-watch, and that hewho had four should pay no taxes: though it is very evident, that whilethe land was divided in this manner, that if the people increased theremust many of them be very poor.Nor was he less blamable for the manner in which he constituted theephori; for these magistrates take cognisance of things of the lastimportance, and yet they are chosen out of the people in general; sothat it often happens that a very poor person is elected to that office,who, from that circumstance, is easily bought. There have been manyinstances of this formerly, as well as in the late affair at Andros. Andthese men, being corrupted with money, went as far as they could to ruinthe city: and, because their power was too great and nearly tyrannical,their kings were obliged to natter them, which contributed greatly tohurt the state; so that it altered from an aristocracy to a democracy.This magistracy is indeed the great support of the state; for the peopleare easy, knowing that they are eligible to the first office in it;so that, whether it took place by the intention of the legislator,or whether it happened by chance, this is of great service to theiraffairs; for it is necessary that every member of the state shouldendeavour that each part of the government should be preserved, andcontinue the same. And upon this principle their kings have alwaysacted, out of regard to their honour; the wise and good from theirattachment to the senate, a seat wherein they consider as the reward ofvirtue; and the common people, that they may support the ephori, of whomthey consist. And it is proper that these magistrates should be chosenout of the whole community, not as the custom is at present, which isvery ridiculous. The ephori are the supreme judges in causes of the lastconsequence; but as it is quite accidental what sort of persons they maybe, it is not right that they should determine according to their ownopinion, but by a written law or established custom. Their way of lifealso is not consistent with the manners of the city, for it is tooindulgent; whereas that of others is too severe; so that they cannotsupport it, but are obliged privately to act contrary to law, that theymay enjoy some of the pleasures of sense. There are also great defectsin the institution of their senators. If indeed they were fitly trainedto the practice of every human virtue, every one would readily admitthat they would be useful to the government; but still it might bedebated whether they should be continued judges for life, to determinepoints of the greatest moment, since the mind has its old age as wellas the body; but as they are so brought up, [1271a] that even thelegislator could not depend upon them as good men, their power mustbe inconsistent with the safety of the state: for it is known that themembers of that body have been guilty both of bribery and partiality inmany public affairs; for which reason it had been much better if theyhad been made answerable for their conduct, which they are not. But itmay be said the ephori seem to have a check upon all the magistrates.They have indeed in this particular very great power; but I affirm thatthey should not be entrusted with this control in the manner they are.Moreover, the mode of choice which they make use of at the election oftheir senators is very childish. Nor is it right for any one to solicitfor a place he is desirous of; for every person, whether he chooses itor not, ought to execute any office he is fit for. But his intention wasevidently the same in this as in the other parts of his government.For making his citizens ambitious after honours, with men of thatdisposition he has filled his senate, since no others will solicit forthat office; and yet the principal part of those crimes which men aredeliberately guilty of arise from ambition and avarice.We will inquire at another time whether the office of a king is usefulto the state: thus much is certain, that they should be chosen from aconsideration of their conduct and not as they are now. But that thelegislator himself did not expect to make all his citizens honourableand completely virtuous is evident from this, that he distrusts them asnot being good men; for he sent those upon the same embassy that were atvariance with each other; and thought, that in the dispute of the kingsthe safety of the state consisted. Neither were their common meals atfirst well established: for these should rather have been provided atthe public expense, as at Crete, where, as at Lacedaemon, every one wasobliged to buy his portion, although he might be very poor, and could byno means bear the expense, by which means the contrary happened to whatthe legislator desired: for he intended that those public meals shouldstrengthen the democratic part of his government: but this regulationhad quite the contrary effect, for those who were very poor could nottake part in them; and it was an observation of their forefathers, thatthe not allowing those who could not contribute their proportion to thecommon tables to partake of them, would be the ruin of the state. Otherpersons have censured his laws concerning naval affairs, and not withoutreason, as it gave rise to disputes. For the commander of the fleet isin a manner set up in opposition to the kings, who are generals of thearmy for life.[1271b] There is also another defect in his laws worthy of censure,which Plato has given in his book of Laws; that the whole constitutionwas calculated only for the business of war: it is indeed excellent tomake them conquerors; for which reason the preservation of the statedepended thereon. The destruction of it commenced with their victories:for they knew not how to be idle, or engage in any other employmentthan war. In this particular also they were mistaken, that though theyrightly thought, that those things which are the objects of contentionamongst mankind are better procured by virtue than vice, yet theywrongfully preferred the things themselves to virtue. Nor was the publicrevenue well managed at Sparta, for the state was worth nothing whilethey were obliged to carry on the most extensive wars, and the subsidieswere very badly raised; for as the Spartans possessed a large extent ofcountry, they were not exact upon each other as to what they paid in.And thus an event contrary to the legislator's intention took place;for the state was poor, the individuals avaricious. Enough of theLacedaemonian government; for these seem the chief defects in it.CHAPTER XThe government of Crete bears a near resemblance to this, in some fewparticulars it is not worse, but in general it is far inferior in itscontrivance. For it appears and is allowed in many particulars theconstitution of Lacedaemon was formed in imitation of that of Crete;and in general most new things are an improvement upon the old. For theysay, that when Lycurgus ceased to be guardian to King Charilles hewent abroad and spent a long time with his relations in Crete, for theLycians are a colony of the Lacedaemonians; and those who first settledthere adopted that body of laws which they found already established bythe inhabitants; in like manner also those who now live near them havethe very laws which Minos first drew up.This island seems formed by nature to be the mistress of Greece, for itis entirely surrounded by a navigable ocean which washes almost all themaritime parts of that country, and is not far distant on the one sidefrom Peloponnesus, on the other, which looks towards Asia, from Triopiumand Rhodes. By means of this situation Minos acquired the empire ofthe sea and the islands; some of which he subdued, in others plantedcolonies: at last he died at Camicus while he was attacking Sicily.There is this analogy between the customs of the Lacedaemonians andthe Cretans, the Helots cultivate the grounds [1272a] for the one, thedomestic slaves for the other. Both states have their common meals, andthe Lacedaemonians called these formerly not _psiditia_ but _andpia_,as the Cretans do; which proves from whence the custom arose. In thisparticular their governments are also alike: the ephori have the samepower with those of Crete, who are called _kosmoi_; with this differenceonly, that the number of the one is five, of the other ten. The senatorsare the same as those whom the Cretans call the council. There wasformerly also a kingly power in Crete; but it was afterwards dissolved,and the command of their armies was given to the _kosmoi_. Every onealso has a vote in their public assembly; but this has only the power ofconfirming what has already passed the council and the _kosmoi_.The Cretans conducted their public meals better than the Lacedaemonians,for at Lacedaemon each individual was obliged to furnish what wasassessed upon him; which if he could not do, there was a law whichdeprived him of the rights of a citizen, as has been already mentioned:but in Crete they were furnished by the community; for all the corn andcattle, taxes and contributions, which the domestic slaves were obligedto furnish, were divided into parts and allotted to the gods, theexigencies of the state, and these public meals; so that all the men,women, and children were maintained from a common stock. The legislatorgave great attention to encourage a habit of eating sparingly, as veryuseful to the citizens. He also endeavoured, that his community mightnot be too populous, to lessen the connection with women, by introducingthe love of boys: whether in this he did well or ill we shall have someother opportunity of considering. But that the public meals were betterordered at Crete than at Lacedaemon is very evident.The institution of the _kosmoi_, was still worse than that of theephori: for it contained all the faults incident to that magistracy andsome peculiar to itself; for in both cases it is uncertain who will beelected: but the Lacedaemonians have this advantage which the othershave not, that as all are eligible, the whole community have a sharein the highest honours, and therefore all desire to preserve the state:whereas among the Cretans the _kosmoi_ are not chosen out of the peoplein general, but out of some certain families, and the senate out of the_kosmoi_. And the same observations which may be made on the senate atLacedaemon may be applied to these; for their being under no control,and their continuing for life, is an honour greater than they merit; andto have their proceedings not regulated by a written law, but left totheir own discretion, is dangerous. (As to there being no insurrections,although the people share not in the management of public affairs, thisis no proof of a well-constituted government, as the _kosmoi_ have noopportunity of being bribed like the ephori, as they live in an [1272b]island far from those who would corrupt them.) But the method they taketo correct that fault is absurd, impolitic, and tyrannical: for veryoften either their fellow-magistrates or some private persons conspiretogether and turn out the _kosmoi_. They are also permitted to resigntheir office before their time is elapsed, and if all this was done bylaw it would be well, and not at the pleasure of the individuals, whichis a bad rule to follow. But what is worst of all is, that generalconfusion which those who are in power introduce to impede the ordinarycourse of justice; which sufficiently shows what is the nature of thegovernment, or rather lawless force: for it is usual with the principalpersons amongst them to collect together some of the common people andtheir friends, and then revolt and set up for themselves, and cometo blows with each other. And what is the difference, if a state isdissolved at once by such violent means, or if it gradually so alters inprocess of time as to be no longer the same constitution? A state likethis would ever be exposed to the invasions of those who were powerfuland inclined to attack it; but, as has been already mentioned, itssituation preserves it, as it is free from the inroads of foreigners;and for this reason the family slaves still remain quiet at Crete, whilethe Helots are perpetually revolting: for the Cretans take no part inforeign affairs, and it is but lately that any foreign troops havemade an attack upon the island; and their ravages soon proved theineffectualness of their laws. And thus much for the government ofCrete.CHAPTER XIThe government of Carthage seems well established, and in many respectssuperior to others; in some particulars it bears a near resemblanceto the Lacedaemonians; and indeed these three states, the Cretans, theLacedaemonians and the Carthaginians are in some things very likeeach other, in others they differ greatly. Amongst many excellentconstitutions this may show how well their government is framed, thatalthough the people are admitted to a share in the administration, theform of it remains unaltered, without any popular insurrections, worthnotice, on the one hand, or degenerating into a tyranny on theother. Now the Carthaginians have these things in common with theLacedaemonians: public tables for those who are connected together bythe tie of mutual friendship, after the manner of their Phiditia; theyhave also a magistracy, consisting of an hundred and four persons,similar to the ephori, or rather selected with more judgment; foramongst the Lacedaemonians, all the citizens are eligible, but amongstthe Carthaginians, they are chosen out of those of the better sort:there is also some analogy between the king and the senate in both thesegovernments, though the Carthaginian method of appointing their kingsis best, for they do not confine themselves to one family; nor dothey permit the election to be at large, nor have they any regard toseniority; for if amongst the candidates there are any of greater meritthan the rest, these they prefer to those who may be older; for as theirpower is very extensive, if they are [1273a] persons of no account,they may be very hurtful to the state, as they have always been tothe Lacedaemonians; also the greater part of those things which becomereprehensible by their excess are common to all those governments whichwe have described.Now of those principles on which the Carthaginians have establishedtheir mixed form of government, composed of an aristocracy anddemocracy, some incline to produce a democracy, others an oligarchy: forinstance, if the kings and the senate are unanimous upon any point indebate, they can choose whether they will bring it before the people orno; but if they disagree, it is to these they must appeal, who are notonly to hear what has been approved of by the senate, but are finallyto determine upon it; and whosoever chooses it, has a right to speakagainst any matter whatsoever that may be proposed, which is notpermitted in other cases. The five, who elect each other, have verygreat and extensive powers; and these choose the hundred, who aremagistrates of the highest rank: their power also continues longer thanany other magistrates, for it commences before they come into office,and is prolonged after they are out of it; and in this particular thestate inclines to an oligarchy: but as they are not elected by lot, butby suffrage, and are not permitted to take money, they are the greatestsupporters imaginable of an aristocracy.The determining all causes by the same magistrates, and not orae in onecourt and another in another, as at Lacedaemon, has the same influence.The constitution of Carthage is now shifting from an aristocracy to anoligarchy, in consequence of an opinion which is favourably entertainedby many, who think that the magistrates in the community ought not tobe persons of family only, but of fortune also; as it is impossiblefor those who are in bad circumstances to support the dignity of theiroffice, or to be at leisure to apply to public business. As choosing menof fortune to be magistrates make a state incline to an oligarchy,and men of abilities to an aristocracy, so is there a third method ofproceeding which took place in the polity of Carthage; for they havean eye to these two particulars when they elect their officers,particularly those of the highest rank, their kings and their generals.It must be admitted, that it was a great fault in their legislator notto guard against the constitution's degenerating from an aristocracy;for this is a most necessary thing to provide for at first, that thosecitizens who have the best abilities should never be obliged to doanything unworthy their character, but be always at leisure to serve thepublic, not only when in office, but also when private persons; for ifonce you are obliged to look among the wealthy, that you may have men atleisure to serve you, your greatest offices, of king and general,will soon become venal; in consequence of which, riches will be morehonourable than virtue and a love of money be the ruling principle inthe city-for what those who have the chief power regard as honourablewill necessarily be the object which the [1273b] citizens in generalwill aim at; and where the first honours are not paid to virtue,there the aristocratic form of government cannot flourish: for itis reasonable to conclude, that those who bought their places shouldgenerally make an advantage of what they laid out their money for; asit is absurd to suppose, that if a man of probity who is poor should bedesirous of gaining something, a bad man should not endeavour to do thesame, especially to reimburse himself; for which reason the magistracyshould be formed of those who are most able to support an aristocracy.It would have been better for the legislature to have passed over thepoverty of men of merit, and only to have taken care to have ensuredthem sufficient leisure, when in office, to attend to public affairs.It seems also improper, that one person should execute several offices,which was approved of at Carthage; for one business is best done by oneperson; and it is the duty of the legislator to look to this, and notmake the same person a musician and a shoemaker: so that where the stateis not small it is more politic and more popular to admit many personsto have a share in the government; for, as I just now said, it is notonly more usual, but everything is better and sooner done, when onething only is allotted to one person: and this is evident both in thearmy and navy, where almost every one, in his turn, both commands andis under command. But as their government inclines to an oligarchy, theyavoid the ill effects of it by always appointing some of the popularparty to the government of cities to make their fortunes. Thus theyconsult this fault in their constitution and render it stable; butthis is depending on chance; whereas the legislator ought to frame hisgovernment, that there the no room for insurrections. But now, if thereshould be any general calamity, and the people should revolt from theirrulers, there is no remedy for reducing them to obedience by the laws.And these are the particulars of the Lacedaemonian, the Cretan, and theCarthaginian governments which seem worthy of commendation.CHAPTER XIISome of those persons who have written upon government had never anyshare in public affairs, but always led a private life. Everythingworthy of notice in their works we have already spoke to. Otherswere legislators, some in their own cities, others were employed inregulating the governments of foreign states. Some of them only composeda body of laws; others formed the constitution also, as Lycurgus; andSolon, who did both. The Lacedaemonians have been already mentioned.Some persons think that Solon was an excellent legislator, who coulddissolve a pure oligarchy, and save the people from that slavery whichhung over them, and establish the ancient democratic form of governmentin his country; wherein every part of it was so framed as to be welladapted to the whole. In the senate of Areopagus an oligarchy waspreserved; by the manner of electing their [1274a] magistrates, anaristocracy; and in their courts of justice, a democracy.Solon seems not to have altered the established form of government,either with respect to the senate or the mode of electing theirmagistrates; but to have raised the people to great consideration in thestate by allotting the supreme judicial department to them; and for thissome persons blame him, as having done what would soon overturn thatbalance of power he intended to establish; for by trying all causeswhatsoever before the people, who were chosen by lot to determine them,it was necessary to flatter a tyrannical populace who had got thispower; which contributed to bring the government to that pure democracyit now is.Both Ephialtes and Pericles abridged the power of the Areopagites, thelatter of whom introduced the method of paying those who attendedthe courts of justice: and thus every one who aimed at being popularproceeded increasing the power of the people to what we now see it. Butit is evident that this was not Solon's intention, but that it arosefrom accident; for the people being the cause of the naval victoryover the Medes, assumed greatly upon it, and enlisted themselvesunder factious demagogues, although opposed by the better part of thecitizens. He thought it indeed most necessary to entrust the peoplewith the choice of their magistrates and the power of calling them toaccount; for without that they must have been slaves and enemies to theother citizens: but he ordered them to elect those only who were personsof good account and property, either out of those who were worth fivehundred medimns, or those who were called xeugitai, or those of thethird census, who were called horsemen.As for those of the fourth, which consisted of mechanics, they wereincapable of any office. Zaleucus was the legislator of the WesternLocrians, as was Charondas, the Catanean, of his own cities, and thosealso in Italy and Sicily which belonged to the Calcidians. Some personsendeavour to prove that Onomacritus, the Locrian, was the first personof note who drew up laws; and that he employed himself in that businesswhile he was at Crete, where he continued some time to learn theprophetic art: and they say, that Thales was his companion; and thatLycurgus and Zaleucus were the scholars of Thales, and Charondas ofZaleucus; but those who advance this, advance what is repugnant tochronology. Philolaus also, of the family of the Bacchiades, was aTheban legislator. This man was very fond of Diocles, a victor inthe Olympic games, and when he left his country from a disgust at animproper passion which his mother Alithoe had entertained for him, andsettled at Thebes, Philolaus followed him, where they both died, andwhere they still show their tombs placed in view of each other, but sodisposed, that one of them looks towards Corinth, the other does not;the reason they give for this is, that Diodes, from his detestation ofhis mother's passion, would have his tomb so placed that no one couldsee Corinth from it; but Philolaus chose that it might be seen from his:and this was the cause of their living at Thebes. [1274b]As Philolaus gave them laws concerning many other things, so did he uponadoption, which they call adoptive laws; and this he in particular didto preserve the number of families. Charondas did nothing new, exceptin actions for perjury, which he was the first person who took intoparticular consideration. He also drew up his laws with greater eleganceand accuracy than even any of our present legislators. Philolausintroduced the law for the equal distribution of goods; Plato that forthe community of women, children, and goods, and also for public tablesfor the women; and one concerning drunkenness, that they might observesobriety in their symposiums. He also made a law concerning theirwarlike exercises; that they should acquire a habit of using both handsalike, as it was necessary that one hand should be as useful as theother.As for Draco's laws, they were published when the government was alreadyestablished, and they have nothing particular in them worth mentioning,except their severity on account of the enormity of their punishments.Pittacus was the author of some laws, but never drew up any form ofgovernment; one of which was this, that if a drunken man beat any personhe should be punished more than if he did it when sober; for aspeople are more apt to be abusive when drunk than sober, he paid noconsideration to the excuse which drunkenness might claim, but regardedonly the common benefit. Andromadas Regmus was also a lawgiver to theThracian talcidians. There are some laws of his concerning murders andheiresses extant, but these contain nothing that any one can say is newand his own. And thus much for different sorts of governments, as wellthose which really exist as those which different persons have proposed.BOOK IIIEvery one who inquires into the nature of government, and what are itsdifferent forms, should make this almost his first question, What is acity? For upon this there is a dispute: for some persons say the citydid this or that, while others say, not the city, but the oligarchy,or the tyranny. We see that the city is the only object which both thepolitician and legislator have in view in all they do: but governmentis a certain ordering of those who inhabit a city. As a city is acollective body, and, like other wholes, composed of many parts, it isevident our first inquiry must be, what a citizen is: for a city is acertain number of citizens. So that we must consider whom we ought tocall citizen, and who is one; for this is often doubtful: for every onewill not allow that this character is applicable to the same person; forthat man who would be a citizen in a republic would very often not beone in an oligarchy. We do not include in this inquiry many of those whoacquire this appellation out of the ordinary way, as honorary persons,for instance, but those only who have a natural right to it.Now it is not residence which constitutes a man a citizen; for in thissojourners and slaves are upon an equality with him; nor will it besufficient for this purpose, that you have the privilege of the laws,and may plead or be impleaded, for this all those of different nations,between whom there is a mutual agreement for that purpose, are allowed;although it very often happens, that sojourners have not a perfect righttherein without the protection of a patron, to whom they are obliged toapply, which shows that their share in the community is incomplete. Inlike manner, with respect to boys who are not yet enrolled, or old menwho are past war, we admit that they are in some respects citizens,but not completely so, but with some exceptions, for these are not yetarrived to years of maturity, and those are past service; nor isthere any difference between them. But what we mean is sufficientlyintelligible and clear, we want a complete citizen, one in whom thereis no deficiency to be corrected to make him so. As to those who arebanished, or infamous, there may be the same objections made and thesame answer given. There is nothing that more characterises a completecitizen than having a share in the judicial and executive part of thegovernment.With respect to offices, some are fixed to a particular time, so thatno person is, on any account, permitted to fill them twice; or elsenot till some certain period has intervened; others are not fixed, as ajuryman's, and a member of the general assembly: but probably some onemay say these are not offices, nor have the citizens in these capacitiesany share in the government; though surely it is ridiculous to say thatthose who have the principal power in the state bear no office in it.But this objection is of no weight, for it is only a dispute aboutwords; as there is no general term which can be applied both to theoffice of a juryman and a member of the assembly. For the sake ofdistinction, suppose we call it an indeterminate office: but I lay itdown as a maxim, that those are citizens who could exercise it. Suchthen is the description of a citizen who comes nearest to what all thosewho are called citizens are. Every one also should know, that of thecomponent parts of those things which differ from each other in species,after the first or second remove, those which follow have either nothingat all or very little common to each.Now we see that governments differ from each other in their form,and that some of them are defective, others [1275b] as excellent aspossible: for it is evident, that those which have many deficienciesand degeneracies in them must be far inferior to those which are withoutsuch faults. What I mean by degeneracies will be hereafter explained.Hence it is clear that the office of a citizen must differ asgovernments do from each other: for which reason he who is calleda citizen has, in a democracy, every privilege which that stationsupposes. In other forms of government he may enjoy them; but notnecessarily: for in some states the people have no power; nor have theyany general assembly, but a few select men.The trial also of different causes is allotted to different persons; asat Lacedaemon all disputes concerning contracts are brought before someof the ephori: the senate are the judges in cases of murder, and so on;some being to be heard by one magistrate, others by another: and thusat Carthage certain magistrates determine all causes. But our formerdescription of a citizen will admit of correction; for in somegovernments the office of a juryman and a member of the general assemblyis not an indeterminate one; but there are particular persons appointedfor these purposes, some or all of the citizens being appointed jurymenor members of the general assembly, and this either for all causes andall public business whatsoever, or else for some particular one: andthis may be sufficient to show what a citizen is; for he who has a rightto a share in the judicial and executive part of government in anycity, him we call a citizen of that place; and a city, in one word, isa collective body of such persons sufficient in themselves to all thepurposes of life.IIn common use they define a citizen to be one who is sprung fromcitizens on both sides, not on the father's or the mother's only. Otherscarry the matter still further, and inquire how many of his ancestorshave been citizens, as his grandfather, great-grandfather, etc., butsome persons have questioned how the first of the family could provethemselves citizens, according to this popular and careless definition.Gorgias of Leontium, partly entertaining the same doubt, and partly injest, says, that as a mortar is made by a mortar-maker, so a citizen ismade by a citizen-maker, and a Larisssean by a Larisssean-maker. Thisis indeed a very simple account of the matter; for if citizens are so,according to this definition, it will be impossible to apply it to thefirst founders or first inhabitants of states, who cannot possibly claimin right either of their father or mother. It is probably a matter ofstill more difficulty to determine their rights as citizens who areadmitted to their freedom after any revolution in the state. As, forinstance, at Athens, after the expulsion of the tyrants, when Clisthenesenrolled many foreigners and city-slaves amongst the tribes; and thedoubt with respect to them was, not whether they were citizens or no,but whether they were legally so or not. Though indeed some persons mayhave this further [1276a] doubt, whether a citizen can be a citizenwhen he is illegally made; as if an illegal citizen, and one who isno citizen at all, were in the same predicament: but since we see somepersons govern unjustly, whom yet we admit to govern, though not justly,and the definition of a citizen is one who exercises certain offices,for such a one we have defined a citizen to be, it is evident, that acitizen illegally created yet continues to be a citizen, but whetherjustly or unjustly so belongs to the former inquiry.IIIt has also been doubted what was and what was not the act of the city;as, for instance, when a democracy arises out of an aristocracy or atyranny; for some persons then refuse to fulfil their contracts; as ifthe right to receive the money was in the tyrant and not in the state,and many other things of the same nature; as if any covenant was foundedfor violence and not for the common good. So in like manner, if anythingis done by those who have the management of public affairs where ademocracy is established, their actions are to be considered as theactions of the state, as well as in the oligarchy or tyranny.And here it seems very proper to consider this question, When shall wesay that a city is the same, and when shall we say that it is different?It is but a superficial mode of examining into this question to beginwith the place and the people; for it may happen that these may bedivided from that, or that some one of them may live in one place, andsome in another (but this question may be regarded as no very knottyone; for, as a city may acquire that appellation on many accounts,it may be solved many ways); and in like manner, when men inhabit onecommon place, when shall we say that they inhabit the same city, or thatthe city is the same? for it does not depend upon the walls; for I cansuppose Peloponnesus itself surrounded with a wall, as Babylon was, andevery other place, which rather encircles many nations than one city,and that they say was taken three days when some of the inhabitantsknew nothing of it: but we shall find a proper time to determine thisquestion; for the extent of a city, how large it should be, and whetherit should consist of more than one people, these are particulars thatthe politician should by no means be unacquainted with. This, too, is amatter of inquiry, whether we shall say that a city is the same whileit is inhabited by the same race of men, though some of them areperpetually dying, others coming into the world, as we say that a riveror a fountain is the same, though the waters are continually changing;or when a revolution takes place shall we [1276b] say the men are thesame, but the city is different: for if a city is a community, it is acommunity of citizens; but if the mode of government should alter, andbecome of another sort, it would seem a necessary consequence that thecity is not the same; as we regard the tragic chorus as different fromthe comic, though it may probably consist of the same performers: thusevery other community or composition is said to be different if thespecies of composition is different; as in music the same hands producedifferent harmony, as the Doric and Phrygian. If this is true, it isevident, that when we speak of a city as being the same we refer to thegovernment there established; and this, whether it is called by thesame name or any other, or inhabited by the same men or different.But whether or no it is right to dissolve the community when theconstitution is altered is another question.VWhat has been said, it follows that we should consider whether thesame virtues which constitute a good man make a valuable citizen, ordifferent; and if a particular inquiry is necessary for this matter wemust first give a general description of the virtues of a good citizen;for as a sailor is one of those who make up a community, so is acitizen, although the province of one sailor may be different fromanother's (for one is a rower, another a steersman, a third a boatswain,and so on, each having their several appointments), it is evident thatthe most accurate description of any one good sailor must refer tohis peculiar abilities, yet there are some things in which the samedescription may be applied to the whole crew, as the safety of the shipis the common business of all of them, for this is the general centre ofall their cares: so also with respect to citizens, although they mayin a few particulars be very different, yet there is one care common tothem all, the safety of the community, for the community of the citizenscomposes the state; for which reason the virtue of a citizen hasnecessarily a reference to the state. But if there are different sortsof governments, it is evident that those actions which constitute thevirtue of an excellent citizen in one community will not constitute itin another; wherefore the virtue of such a one cannot be perfect: but wesay, a man is good when his virtues are perfect; from whence it follows,that an excellent citizen does not possess that virtue which constitutesa good man. Those who are any ways doubtful concerning this questionmay be convinced of the truth of it by examining into the best formedstates: for, if it is impossible that a city should consist entirely ofexcellent citizens (while it is necessary that every one should do wellin his calling, in which consists his excellence, as it is impossiblethat all the citizens should have the same [1277a] qualifications) itis impossible that the virtue of a citizen and a good man should be thesame; for all should possess the virtue of an excellent citizen: forfrom hence necessarily arise the perfection of the city: but that everyone should possess the virtue of a good man is impossible withoutall the citizens in a well-regulated state were necessarily virtuous.Besides, as a city is composed of dissimilar parts, as an animal is oflife and body; the soul of reason and appetite; a family of a man andhis wife--property of a master and a slave; in the same manner, as acity is composed of all these and many other very different parts, itnecessarily follows that the virtue of all the citizens cannot be thesame; as the business of him who leads the band is different from theother dancers. From all which proofs it is evident that the virtues ofa citizen cannot be one and the same. But do we never find those virtuesunited which constitute a good man and excellent citizen? for we say,such a one is an excellent magistrate and a prudent and good man; butprudence is a necessary qualification for all those who engage in publicaffairs. Nay, some persons affirm that the education of those who areintended to command should, from the beginning, be different from othercitizens, as the children of kings are generally instructed in ridingand warlike exercises; and thus Euripides says:  \"... No showy arts Be mine, but teach me what the state requires.\"As if those who are to rule were to have an education peculiar tothemselves. But if we allow, that the virtues of a good man and agood magistrate may be the same, and a citizen is one who obeys themagistrate, it follows that the virtue of the one cannot in general bethe same as the virtue of the other, although it may be true of someparticular citizen; for the virtue of the magistrate must be differentfrom the virtue of the citizen. For which reason Jason declared thatwas he deprived of his kingdom he should pine away with regret, as notknowing how to live a private man. But it is a great recommendation toknow how to command as well as to obey; and to do both these things wellis the virtue of an accomplished citizen. If then the virtue of a goodman consists only in being able to command, but the virtue of a goodcitizen renders him equally fit for the one as well as the other, thecommendation of both of them is not the same. It appears, then, thatboth he who commands and he who obeys should each of them learn theirseparate business: but that the citizen should be master of andtake part in both these, as any one may easily perceive; in a familygovernment there is no occasion for the master to know how to performthe necessary offices, but rather to enjoy the labour of others; for todo the other is a servile part. I mean by the other, the common familybusiness of the slave.There are many sorts of slaves; for their employments are various: ofthese the handicraftsmen are one, who, as their name imports, get theirliving by the labour of their hands, and amongst these all mechanics areincluded; [1277b] for which reasons such workmen, in some states, werenot formerly admitted into any share in the government; till at lengthdemocracies were established: it is not therefore proper for any manof honour, or any citizen, or any one who engages in public affairs, tolearn these servile employments without they have occasion for them fortheir own use; for without this was observed the distinction between amaster and a slave would be lost. But there is a government of anothersort, in which men govern those who are their equals in rank, andfreemen, which we call a political government, in which men learn tocommand by first submitting to obey, as a good general of horse, or acommander-in-chief, must acquire a knowledge of their duty byhaving been long under the command of another, and the like in everyappointment in the army: for well is it said, no one knows how tocommand who has not himself been under command of another. The virtuesof those are indeed different, but a good citizen must necessarily beendowed with them; he ought also to know in what manner freemen oughtto govern, as well as be governed: and this, too, is the duty of a goodman. And if the temperance and justice of him who commands is differentfrom his who, though a freeman, is under command, it is evident that thevirtues of a good citizen cannot be the same as justice, for instancebut must be of a different species in these two different situations, asthe temperance and courage of a man and a woman are different from eachother; for a man would appear a coward who had only that courage whichwould be graceful in a woman, and a woman would be thought a talker whoshould take as large a part in the conversation as would become a man ofconsequence.The domestic employments of each of them are also different; it is theman's business to acquire subsistence, the woman's to take care of it.But direction and knowledge of public affairs is a virtue peculiar tothose who govern, while all others seem to be equally requisite for bothparties; but with this the governed have no concern, it is theirs toentertain just notions: they indeed are like flute-makers, while thosewho govern are the musicians who play on them. And thus much to showwhether the virtue of a good man and an excellent citizen is the same,or if it is different, and also how far it is the same, and how fardifferent.CHAPTER VBut with respect to citizens there is a doubt remaining, whether thoseonly are truly so who are allowed to share in the government, or whetherthe mechanics also are to be considered as such? for if those who arenot permitted to rule are to be reckoned among them, it is impossiblethat the virtue of all the citizens should be the same, for these alsoare citizens; and if none of them are admitted to be citizens, whereshall they be ranked? for they are neither [1278a] sojourners norforeigners? or shall we say that there will no inconvenience arise fromtheir not being citizens, as they are neither slaves nor freedmen:for this is certainly true, that all those are not citizens who arenecessary to the existence of a city, as boys are not citizens in thesame manner that men are, for those are perfectly so, the others undersome conditions; for they are citizens, though imperfect ones: forin former times among some people the mechanics were either slaves orforeigners, for which reason many of them are so now: and indeed thebest regulated states will not permit a mechanic to be a citizen; butif it be allowed them, we cannot then attribute the virtue we havedescribed to every citizen or freeman, but to those only who aredisengaged from servile offices. Now those who are employed by oneperson in them are slaves; those who do them for money are mechanicsand hired servants: hence it is evident on the least reflection what istheir situation, for what I have said is fully explained by appearances.Since the number of communities is very great, it follows necessarilythat there will be many different sorts of citizens, particularlyof those who are governed by others, so that in one state it may benecessary to admit mechanics and hired servants to be citizens, but inothers it may be impossible; as particularly in an aristocracy, wherehonours are bestowed on virtue and dignity: for it is impossible forone who lives the life of a mechanic or hired servant to acquire thepractice of virtue. In an oligarchy also hired servants are not admittedto be citizens; because there a man's right to bear any office isregulated by his fortune; but mechanics are, for many citizens are veryrich.There was a law at Thebes that no one could have a share in thegovernment till he had been ten years out of trade. In many states thelaw invites strangers to accept the freedom of the city; and in somedemocracies the son of a free-woman is himself free. The same is alsoobserved in many others with respect to natural children; but it isthrough want of citizens regularly born that they admit such: for theselaws are always made in consequence of a scarcity of inhabitants; so,as their numbers increase, they first deprive the children of a male orfemale slave of this privilege, next the child of a free-woman, and lastof all they will admit none but those whose fathers and mothers wereboth free.That there are many sorts of citizens, and that he may be said to be ascompletely who shares the honours of the state, is evident from whathas been already said. Thus Achilles, in Homer, complains of Agamemnon'streating him like an unhonoured stranger; for a stranger or sojourner isone who does not partake of the honours of the state: and whenever theright to the freedom of the city is kept obscure, it is for the sake ofthe inhabitants. [1278b] From what has been said it is plain whether thevirtue of a good man and an excellent citizen is the same or different:and we find that in some states it is the same, in others not; and alsothat this is not true of each citizen, but of those only who take thelead, or are capable of taking the lead, in public affairs, either aloneor in conjunction with others.CHAPTER VIHaving established these points, we proceed next to consider whether oneform of government only should be established, or more than one; and ifmore, how many, and of what sort, and what are the differences betweenthem. The form of government is the ordering and regulating of the city,and all the offices in it, particularly those wherein the supreme poweris lodged; and this power is always possessed by the administration; butthe administration itself is that particular form of government whichis established in any state: thus in a democracy the supreme power islodged in the whole people; on the contrary, in an oligarchy it is inthe hands of a few. We say then, that the form of government in thesestates is different, and we shall find the same thing hold good inothers. Let us first determine for whose sake a city is established;and point out the different species of rule which man may submit to insocial life.I have already mentioned in my treatise on the management of a family,and the power of the master, that man is an animal naturally formedfor society, and that therefore, when he does not want any foreignassistance, he will of his own accord desire to live with others; notbut that mutual advantage induces them to it, as far as it enables eachperson to live more agreeably; and this is indeed the great objectnot only to all in general, but also to each individual: but it is notmerely matter of choice, but they join in society also, even that theymay be able to live, which probably is not without some share of merit,and they also support civil society, even for the sake of preservinglife, without they are grievously overwhelmed with the miseries of it:for it is very evident that men will endure many calamities for the sakeof living, as being something naturally sweet and desirable. It is easyto point out the different modes of government, and we have alreadysettled them in our exoteric discourses. The power of the master, thoughby nature equally serviceable, both to the master and to the slave, yetnevertheless has for its object the benefit of the master, while thebenefit of the slave arises accidentally; for if the slave is destroyed,the power of the master is at an end: but the authority which a manhas over his wife, and children, and his family, which we call domesticgovernment, is either for the benefit of those who are under subjection,or else for the common benefit of the whole: but its particular objectis the benefit of the governed, as we see in other arts; in physic, forinstance, and the gymnastic exercises, wherein, if any benefit [1279a]arise to the master, it is accidental; for nothing forbids the master ofthe exercises from sometimes being himself one of those who exercises,as the steersman is always one of the sailors; but both the master ofthe exercises and the steersman consider the good of those who are undertheir government. Whatever good may happen to the steersman when he isa sailor, or to the master of the exercises when he himself makes one atthe games, is not intentional, or the object of their power; thus in allpolitical governments which are established to preserve and defend theequality of the citizens it is held right to rule by turns. Formerly, aswas natural, every one expected that each of his fellow-citizens shouldin his turn serve the public, and thus administer to his private good,as he himself when in office had done for others; but now every one isdesirous of being continually in power, that he may enjoy the advantagewhich he makes of public business and being in office; as if places werea never-failing remedy for every complaint, and were on that account soeagerly sought after.It is evident, then, that all those governments which have a common goodin view are rightly established and strictly just, but those who havein view only the good of the rulers are all founded on wrong principles,and are widely different from what a government ought to be, for theyare tyranny over slaves, whereas a city is a community of freemen.CHAPTER VIIHaving established these particulars, we come to consider next thedifferent number of governments which there are, and what they are; andfirst, what are their excellencies: for when we have determined this,their defects will be evident enough.It is evident that every form of government or administration, for thewords are of the same import, must contain a supreme power over thewhole state, and this supreme power must necessarily be in the handsof one person, or a few, or many; and when either of these apply theirpower for the common good, such states are well governed; but when theinterest of the one, the few, or the many who enjoy this power is aloneconsulted, then ill; for you must either affirm that those who makeup the community are not citizens, or else let these share in theadvantages of government. We usually call a state which is governed byone person for the common good, a kingdom; one that is governed bymore than one, but by a few only, an aristocracy; either because thegovernment is in the hands of the most worthy citizens, or because itis the best form for the city and its inhabitants. When the citizens atlarge govern for the public good, it is called a state; which is alsoa common name for all other governments, and these distinctions areconsonant to reason; for it will not be difficult to find one person,or a very few, of very distinguished abilities, but almost impossible tomeet with the majority [1279b] of a people eminent for every virtue;but if there is one common to a whole nation it is valour; for this iscreated and supported by numbers: for which reason in such a statethe profession of arms will always have the greatest share in thegovernment.Now the corruptions attending each of these governments are these; akingdom may degenerate into a tyranny, an aristocracy into an oligarchy,and a state into a democracy. Now a tyranny is a monarchy where the goodof one man only is the object of government, an oligarchy considersonly the rich, and a democracy only the poor; but neither of them have acommon good in view.CHAPTER VIIIIt will be necessary to enlarge a little more upon the nature of eachof these states, which is not without some difficulty, for he who wouldenter into a philosophical inquiry into the principles of them, and notcontent himself with a superficial view of their outward conduct, mustpass over and omit nothing, but explain the true spirit of each of them.A tyranny then is, as has been said, a monarchy, where one person hasan absolute and despotic power over the whole community and every membertherein: an oligarchy, where the supreme power of the state is lodgedwith the rich: a democracy, on the contrary, is where those have it whoare worth little or nothing. But the first difficulty that arises fromthe distinctions which we have laid down is this, should it happen thatthe majority of the inhabitants who possess the power of the state (forthis is a democracy) should be rich, the question is, how does thisagree with what we have said? The same difficulty occurs, should it everhappen that the poor compose a smaller part of the people than the rich,but from their superior abilities acquire the supreme power; for this iswhat they call an oligarchy; it should seem then that our definitionof the different states was not correct: nay, moreover, could any onesuppose that the majority of the people were poor, and the minorityrich, and then describe the state in this manner, that an oligarchywas a government in which the rich, being few in number, possessed thesupreme power, and that a democracy was a state in which the poor, beingmany in number, possessed it, still there will be another difficulty;for what name shall we give to those states we have been describing? Imean, that in which the greater number are rich, and that in which thelesser number are poor (where each of these possess the supreme power),if there are no other states than those we have described. It seemstherefore evident to reason, that whether the supreme power is vestedin the hands of many or few may be a matter of accident; but that itis clear enough, that when it is in the hands of the few, it will bea government of the rich; when in the hands of the many, it will be agovernment of the poor; since in all countries there are many poor andfew rich: it is not therefore the cause that has been already assigned(namely, the number of people in power) that makes the differencebetween the two governments; but an oligarchy and democracy differ inthis from each other, in the poverty of those who govern in the one,and the riches I28oa of those who govern in the other; for when thegovernment is in the hands of the rich, be they few or be they more, itis an oligarchy; when it is in the hands of the poor, it is a democracy:but, as we have already said, the one will be always few, the othernumerous, but both will enjoy liberty; and from the claims of wealth andliberty will arise continual disputes with each other for the lead inpublic affairs.XLet us first determine what are the proper limits of an oligarchy anda democracy, and what is just in each of these states; for all men havesome natural inclination to justice; but they proceed therein only toa certain degree; nor can they universally point out what is absolutelyjust; as, for instance, what is equal appears just, and is so; but notto all; only among those who are equals: and what is unequal appearsjust, and is so; but not to all, only amongst those who are unequals;which circumstance some people neglect, and therefore judge ill; thereason for which is, they judge for themselves, and every one almost isthe worst judge in his own cause. Since then justice has reference topersons, the same distinctions must be made with respect to personswhich are made with respect to things, in the manner that I have alreadydescribed in my Ethics.As to the equality of the things, these they agree in; but their disputeis concerning the equality of the persons, and chiefly for the reasonabove assigned; because they judge ill in their own cause; and alsobecause each party thinks, that if they admit what is right in someparticulars, they have done justice on the whole: thus, for instance,if some persons are unequal in riches, they suppose them unequal in thewhole; or, on the contrary, if they are equal in liberty, they supposethem equal in the whole: but what is absolutely just they omit; forif civil society was founded for the sake of preserving and increasingproperty, every one's right in the city would be equal to his fortune;and then the reasoning of those who insist upon an oligarchy would bevalid; for it would not be right that he who contributed one mina shouldhave an equal share in the hundred along with him who brought in all therest, either of the original money or what was afterwards acquired.Nor was civil society founded merely to preserve the lives of itsmembers; but that they might live well: for otherwise a state mightbe composed of slaves, or the animal creation: but this is not so; forthese have no share in the happiness of it; nor do they live after theirown choice; nor is it an alliance mutually to defend each other frominjuries, or for a commercial intercourse: for then the Tyrrhenians andCarthaginians, and all other nations between whom treaties of commercesubsist, would be citizens of one city; for they have articlesto regulate their exports and imports, and engagements for mutualprotection, and alliances for mutual defence; but [1280b] yet theyhave not all the same magistrates established among them, but they aredifferent among the different people; nor does the one take any care,that the morals of the other should be as they ought, or that none ofthose who have entered into the common agreements should be unjust, orin any degree vicious, only that they do not injure any member of theconfederacy. But whosoever endeavours to establish wholesome laws ina state, attends to the virtues and the vices of each individual whocomposes it; from whence it is evident, that the first care of him whowould found a city, truly deserving that name, and not nominally so,must be to have his citizens virtuous; for otherwise it is merely analliance for self-defence; differing from those of the same cast whichare made between different people only in place: for law is an agreementand a pledge, as the sophist Lycophron says, between the citizens oftheir intending to do justice to each other, though not sufficient tomake all the citizens just and good: and that this is fact is evident,for could any one bring different places together, as, for instance,enclose Megara and Corinth in a wall, yet they would not be one city,not even if the inhabitants intermarried with each other, though thisinter-community contributes much to make a place one city. Besides,could we suppose a set of people to live separate from each other, butwithin such a distance as would admit of an intercourse, and that therewere laws subsisting between each party, to prevent their injuring oneanother in their mutual dealings, supposing one a carpenter, anothera husbandman, shoemaker, and the like, and that their numbers were tenthousand, still all that they would have together in common would be atariff for trade, or an alliance for mutual defence, but not the samecity. And why? not because their mutual intercourse is not near enough,for even if persons so situated should come to one place, and every oneshould live in his own house as in his native city, and there should bealliances subsisting between each party to mutually assist and preventany injury being done to the other, still they would not be admittedto be a city by those who think correctly, if they preserved the samecustoms when they were together as when they were separate.It is evident, then, that a city is not a community of place; norestablished for the sake of mutual safety or traffic with each other;but that these things are the necessary consequences of a city, althoughthey may all exist where there is no city: but a city is a society ofpeople joining together with their families and their children to liveagreeably for the sake of having their lives as happy and as independentas possible: and for this purpose it is necessary that they should livein one place and intermarry with each other: hence in all cities thereare family-meetings, clubs, sacrifices, and public entertainments topromote friendship; for a love of sociability is friendship itself;so that the end then for which a city is established is, that theinhabitants of it may live happy, and these things are conducive to thatend: for it is a community of families and villages for the sake of aperfect independent life; that is, as we have already said, for the sakeof living well and happily. It is not therefore founded for the purposeof men's merely [1281a] living together, but for their living as menought; for which reason those who contribute most to this end deserve tohave greater power in the city than those who are their equals in familyand freedom, but their inferiors in civil virtue, or those who excelthem in wealth but are below them in worth. It is evident from whathas been said, that in all disputes upon government each party sayssomething that is just.CHAPTER XIt may also be a doubt where the supreme power ought to be lodged.Shall it be with the majority, or the wealthy, with a number of properpersons, or one better than the rest, or with a tyrant? But whicheverof these we prefer some difficulty will arise. For what? shall thepoor have it because they are the majority? they may then divide amongthemselves, what belongs to the rich: nor is this unjust; because trulyit has been so judged by the supreme power. But what avails it to pointout what is the height of injustice if this is not? Again, if the manyseize into their own hands everything which belongs to the few, it isevident that the city will be at an end. But virtue will never destroywhat is virtuous; nor can what is right be the ruin of the state:therefore such a law can never be right, nor can the acts of a tyrantever be wrong, for of necessity they must all be just; for he, from hisunlimited power, compels every one to obey his command, as the multitudeoppress the rich. Is it right then that the rich, the few, should havethe supreme power? and what if they be guilty of the same rapine andplunder the possessions of the majority, that will be as right as theother: but that all things of this sort are wrong and unjust is evident.Well then, these of the better sort shall have it: but must not then allthe other citizens live unhonoured, without sharing the offices of thecity; for the offices of a city are its honours, and if one set of menare always in power, it is evident that the rest must be without honour.Well then, let it be with one person of all others the fittest for it:but by this means the power will be still more contracted, and a greaternumber than before continue unhonoured. But some one may say, that it iswrong to let man have the supreme power and not the law, as his soul issubject to so many passions. But if this law appoints an aristocracy, ora democracy, how will it help us in our present doubts? for those thingswill happen which we have already mentioned.CHAPTER XIOther particulars we will consider separately; but it seems proper toprove, that the supreme power ought to be lodged with the many, ratherthan with those of the better sort, who are few; and also to explainwhat doubts (and probably just ones) may arise: now, though not oneindividual of the many may himself be fit for the supreme power, yetwhen these many are joined together, it does not follow but they may bebetter qualified for it than those; and this not separately, but as acollective body; as the public suppers exceed those which are given atone person's private expense: for, as they are many, each person bringsin his share of virtue and wisdom; and thus, coming together, they arelike one man made up of a multitude, with many feet, many hands,and many intelligences: thus is it with respect to the manners andunderstandings of the multitude taken together; for which reason thepublic are the best judges of music and poetry; for some understandone part, some another, and all collectively the whole; and in thisparticular men of consequence differ from each of the many; as theysay those who are beautiful do from those who are not so, and as finepictures excel any natural objects, by collecting the several beautifulparts which were dispersed among different originals into one, althoughthe separate parts, as the eye or any other, might be handsomer than inthe picture.But if this distinction is to be made between every people and everygeneral assembly, and some few men of consequence, it may be doubtfulwhether it is true; nay, it is clear enough that, with respect to a few,it is not; since the same conclusion might be applied even to brutes:and indeed wherein do some men differ from brutes? Not but that nothingprevents what I have said being true of the people in some states. Thedoubt then which we have lately proposed, with all its consequences, maybe settled in this manner; it is necessary that the freemen who composethe bulk of the people should have absolute power in some things; but asthey are neither men of property, nor act uniformly upon principlesof virtue, it is not safe to trust them with the first offices in thestate, both on account of their iniquity and their ignorance; fromthe one of which they will do what is wrong, from the other they willmistake: and yet it is dangerous to allow them no power or share in thegovernment; for when there are many poor people who are incapable ofacquiring the honours of their country, the state must necessarily havemany enemies in it; let them then be permitted to vote in the publicassemblies and to determine causes; for which reason Socrates, and someother legislators, gave them the power of electing the officers of thestate, and also of inquiring into their conduct when they came out ofoffice, and only prevented their being magistrates by themselves;for the multitude when they are collected together have all of themsufficient understanding for these purposes, and, mixing among those ofhigher rank, are serviceable to the city, as some things, which aloneare improper for food, when mixed with others make the whole morewholesome than a few of them would be.But there is a difficulty attending this form of government, for itseems, that the person who himself was capable of curing any one whowas then sick, must be the best judge whom to employ as a physician; butsuch a one must be himself a physician; and the same holds true in everyother practice and art: and as a physician ought [1282a] to give anaccount of his practice to a physician, so ought it to be in other arts:those whose business is physic may be divided into three sorts, thefirst of these is he who makes up the medicines; the second prescribes,and is to the other as the architect is to the mason; the third is hewho understands the science, but never practises it: now these threedistinctions may be found in those who understand all other arts; norhave we less opinion of their judgment who are only instructed in theprinciples of the art than of those who practise it: and with respectto elections the same method of proceeding seems right; for to elect aproper person in any science is the business of those who are skilfultherein; as in geometry, of geometricians; in steering, of steersmen:but if some individuals should know something of particular arts andworks, they do not know more than the professors of them: so that evenupon this principle neither the election of magistrates, nor the censureof their conduct, should be entrusted to the many.But probably all that has been here said may not be right; for, toresume the argument I lately used, if the people are not very brutalindeed, although we allow that each individual knows less of theseaffairs than those who have given particular attention to them, yet whenthey come together they will know them better, or at least not worse;besides, in some particular arts it is not the workman only who is thebest judge; namely, in those the works of which are understood by thosewho do not profess them: thus he who builds a house is not the onlyjudge of it, for the master of the family who inhabits it is a better;thus also a steersman is a better judge of a tiller than he who madeit; and he who gives an entertainment than the cook. What has been saidseems a sufficient solution of this difficulty; but there is anotherthat follows: for it seems absurd that the power of the state should belodged with those who are but of indifferent morals, instead of thosewho are of excellent characters. Now the power of election and censureare of the utmost consequence, and this, as has been said, in somestates they entrust to the people; for the general assembly is thesupreme court of all, and they have a voice in this, and deliberate inall public affairs, and try all causes, without any objection to themeanness of their circumstances, and at any age: but their treasurers,generals, and other great officers of state are taken from men of greatfortune and worth. This difficulty also may be solved upon the sameprinciple; and here too they may be right, for the power is not in theman who is member of the assembly, or council, but the assembly itself,and the council, and the people, of which each individual of the wholecommunity are the parts, I mean as senator, adviser, or judge; for whichreason it is very right, that the many should have the greatest powersin their own hands; for the people, the council, and the judges arecomposed of them, and the property of all these collectively is morethan the property of any person or a few who fill the great offices ofthe state: and thus I determine these points.The first question that we stated shows plainly, that the supremepower should be lodged in laws duly made and that the magistrate ormagistrates, either one or more, should be authorised to determine thosecases which the laws cannot particularly speak to, as it is impossiblefor them, in general language, to explain themselves upon everythingthat may arise: but what these laws are which are established upon thebest foundations has not been yet explained, but still remains a matterof some question: but the laws of every state will necessarily be likeevery state, either trifling or excellent, just or unjust; for it isevident, that the laws must be framed correspondent to the constitutionof the government; and, if so, it is plain, that a well-formedgovernment will have good laws, a bad one, bad ones.CHAPTER XIISince in every art and science the end aimed at is always good, soparticularly in this, which is the most excellent of all, the foundingof civil society, the good wherein aimed at is justice; for it is thiswhich is for the benefit of all. Now, it is the common opinion, thatjustice is a certain equality; and in this point all the philosophersare agreed when they treat of morals: for they say what is just, and towhom; and that equals ought to receive equal: but we should know howwe are to determine what things are equal and what unequal; and inthis there is some difficulty, which calls for the philosophy of thepolitician. Some persons will probably say, that the employments of thestate ought to be given according to every particular excellence of eachcitizen, if there is no other difference between them and the rest ofthe community, but they are in every respect else alike: for justiceattributes different things to persons differing from each other intheir character, according to their respective merits. But if this isadmitted to be true, complexion, or height, or any such advantage willbe a claim for a greater share of the public rights. But that this isevidently absurd is clear from other arts and sciences; for with respectto musicians who play on the flute together, the best flute is not givento him who is of the best family, for he will play never the better forthat, but the best instrument ought to be given to him who is the bestartist.If what is now said does not make this clear, we will explain it stillfurther: if there should be any one, a very excellent player on theflute, but very deficient in family and beauty, though each of them aremore valuable endowments than a skill in music, and excel this art in ahigher degree than that player excels others, yet the best flutes oughtto be given to him; for the superiority [1283a] in beauty and fortuneshould have a reference to the business in hand; but these have none.Moreover, according to this reasoning, every possible excellence mightcome in comparison with every other; for if bodily strength mightdispute the point with riches or liberty, even any bodily strength mightdo it; so that if one person excelled in size more than another did invirtue, and his size was to qualify him to take place of the other'svirtue, everything must then admit of a comparison with each other; forif such a size is greater than virtue by so much, it is evident anothermust be equal to it: but, since this is impossible, it is plain that itwould be contrary to common sense to dispute a right to any office inthe state from every superiority whatsoever: for if one person is slowand the other swift, neither is the one better qualified nor the otherworse on that account, though in the gymnastic races a difference inthese particulars would gain the prize; but a pretension to the officesof the state should be founded on a superiority in those qualificationswhich are useful to it: for which reason those of family, independency,and fortune, with great propriety, contend with each other for them; forthese are the fit persons to fill them: for a city can no more consistof all poor men than it can of all slaves But if such persons arerequisite, it is evident that those also who are just and valiant areequally so; for without justice and valour no state can be supported,the former being necessary for its existence, the latter for itshappiness.CHAPTER XIIIIt seems, then, requisite for the establishment of a state, that all, orat least many of these particulars should be well canvassed and inquiredinto; and that virtue and education may most justly claim the right ofbeing considered as the necessary means of making the citizens happy, aswe have already said. As those who are equal in one particular are nottherefore equal in all, and those who are unequal in one particularare not therefore unequal in all, it follows that all those governmentswhich are established upon a principle which supposes they are, areerroneous.We have already said, that all the members of the community will disputewith each other for the offices of the state; and in some particularsjustly, but not so in general; the rich, for instance, because theyhave the greatest landed property, and the ultimate right to the soil isvested in the community; and also because their fidelity is in generalmost to be depended on. The freemen and men of family will dispute thepoint with each other, as nearly on an equality; for these latter havea right to a higher regard as citizens than obscure persons, forhonourable descent is everywhere of great esteem: nor is it an improperconclusion, that the descendants of men of worth will be men of worththemselves; for noble birth is the fountain of virtue to men of family:for the same reason also we justly say, that virtue has a right to putin her pretensions. Justice, for instance, is a virtue, and so necessaryto society, that all others must yield her the precedence.Let us now see what the many have to urge on their side against the few;and they may say, that if, when collectively taken, they are comparedwith them, they are stronger, richer, and better than they are. Butshould it ever happen that all these should inhabit the [1283b] samecity, I mean the good, the rich, the noble, as well as the many, such asusually make up the community, I ask, will there then be any reason todispute concerning who shall govern, or will there not? for in everycommunity which we have mentioned there is no dispute where the supremepower should be placed; for as these differ from each other, so do thosein whom that is placed; for in one state the rich enjoy it, in othersthe meritorious, and thus each according to their separate manners. Letus however consider what is to be done when all these happen at the sametime to inhabit the same city. If the virtuous should be very few innumber, how then shall we act? shall we prefer the virtuous on accountof their abilities, if they are capable of governing the city? or shouldthey be so many as almost entirely to compose the state?There is also a doubt concerning the pretensions of all those who claimthe honours of government: for those who found them either on fortune orfamily have nothing which they can justly say in their defence; sinceit is evident upon their principle, that if any one person can be foundricher than all the rest, the right of governing all these will bejustly vested in this one person. In the same manner, one man who isof the best family will claim it from those who dispute the point uponfamily merit: and probably in an aristocracy the same dispute mightarise on the score of virtue, if there is one man better than all theother men of worth who are in the same community; it seems just, by thesame reasoning, that he should enjoy the supreme power. And upon thisprinciple also, while the many suppose they ought to have the supremecommand, as being more powerful than the few, if one or more than one,though a small number should be found stronger than themselves, theseought rather to have it than they.All these things seem to make it plain, that none of these principlesare justly founded on which these persons would establish their right tothe supreme power; and that all men whatsoever ought to obey them:for with respect to those who claim it as due to their virtue or theirfortune, they might have justly some objection to make; for nothinghinders but that it may sometimes happen, that the many may be betteror richer than the few, not as individuals, but in their collectivecapacity.As to the doubt which some persons have proposed and objected, we mayanswer it in this manner; it is this, whether a legislator, who wouldestablish the most perfect system of laws, should calculate them forthe use of the better part of the citizens, or the many, in thecircumstances we have already mentioned? The rectitude of anythingconsists in its equality; that therefore which is equally right will beadvantageous to the whole state, and to every member of it in common.Now, in general, a citizen is one who both shares in the government andalso in his turn submits to be governed; [1284a] their condition, it istrue, is different in different states: the best is that in which a manis enabled to choose and to persevere in a course of virtue during hiswhole life, both in his public and private state. But should there beone person, or a very few, eminent for an uncommon degree of virtue,though not enough to make up a civil state, so that the virtue of themany, or their political abilities, should be too inferior to come incomparison with theirs, if more than one; or if but one, with his only;such are not to be considered as part of the city; for it would be doingthem injustice to rate them on a level with those who are so far theirinferiors in virtue and political abilities, that they appear to themlike a god amongst men. From whence it is evident, that a system of lawsmust be calculated for those who are equal to each other in nature andpower. Such men, therefore, are not the object of law; for they arethemselves a law: and it would be ridiculous in any one to endeavour toinclude them in the penalties of a law: for probably they might say whatAntisthenes tells us the lions did to the hares when they demanded tobe admitted to an equal share with them in the government. And it is onthis account that democratic states have established the ostracism; foran equality seems the principal object of their government. For whichreason they compel all those who are very eminent for their power, theirfortune, their friendships, or any other cause which may give them toogreat weight in the government, to submit to the ostracism, and leavethe city for a stated time; as the fabulous histories relate theArgonauts served Hercules, for they refused to take him with them in theship Argo on account of his superior valour. For which reason those whohate a tyranny and find fault with the advice which Periander gave toThrasybulus, must not think there was nothing to be said in its defence;for the story goes, that Periander said nothing to the messenger inanswer to the business he was consulted about, but striking off thoseears of corn which were higher than the rest, reduced the whole crop toa level; so that the messenger, without knowing the cause of what wasdone, related the fact to Thrasybulus, who understood by it that he musttake off all the principal men in the city. Nor is this serviceable totyrants only; nor is it tyrants only who do it; for the same thing ispractised both in oligarchies and democracies: for the ostracism has ina manner nearly the same power, by restraining and banishing those whoare too great; and what is done in one city is done also by those whohave the supreme power in separate states; as the Athenians with respectto the Samians, the Chians, and the Lesbians; for when they suddenlyacquired the superiority over all Greece, they brought the other statesinto subjection, contrary to the treaties which subsisted between them.The King of Persia also very often reduces the Medes and Babylonianswhen they assume upon their former power: [1284b] and this is aprinciple which all governments whatsoever keep in their eye; even thosewhich are best administered, as well as those which are not, do it;these for the sake of private utility, the others for the public good.The same thing is to be perceived in the other arts and sciences; fora painter would not represent an animal with a foot disproportionallylarge, though he had drawn it remarkably beautiful; nor would theshipwright make the prow or any other part of the vessel larger than itought to be; nor will the master of the band permit any who singslouder and better than the rest to sing in concert with them. There istherefore no reason that a monarch should not act in agreement withfree states, to support his own power, if they do the same thing for thebenefit of their respective communities; upon which account when thereis any acknowledged difference in the power of the citizens, the reasonupon which the ostracism is founded will be politically just; but it isbetter for the legislator so to establish his state at the beginning asnot to want this remedy: but if in course of time such an inconvenienceshould arise, to endeavour to amend it by some such correction. Not thatthis was the use it was put to: for many did not regard the benefit oftheir respective communities, but made the ostracism a weapon in thehand of sedition.It is evident, then, that in corrupt governments it is partly just anduseful to the individual, though probably it is as clear that it is notentirely just: for in a well-governed state there may be great doubtsabout the use of it, not on account of the pre-eminence which one mayhave in strength, riches, or connection: but when the pre-eminence isvirtue, what then is to be done? for it seems not right to turn out andbanish such a one; neither does it seem right to govern him, for thatwould be like desiring to share the power with Jupiter and to governhim: nothing then remains but what indeed seems natural, and that is forall persons quietly to submit to the government of those who are thuseminently virtuous, and let them be perpetually kings in the separatestates.CHAPTER XIVWhat has been now said, it seems proper to change our subject and toinquire into the nature of monarchies; for we have already admitted themto be one of those species of government which are properly founded. Andhere let us consider whether a kingly government is proper for a city ora country whose principal object is the happiness of the inhabitants,or rather some other. But let us first determine whether this is of onekind only, or more; [1285a] and it is easy to know that it consists ofmany different species, and that the forms of government are not thesame in all: for at Sparta the kingly power seems chiefly regulated bythe laws; for it is not supreme in all circumstances; but when the kingquits the territories of the state he is their general in war; and allreligious affairs are entrusted to him: indeed the kingly power withthem is chiefly that of a general who cannot be called to an account forhis conduct, and whose command is for life: for he has not the powerof life and death, except as a general; as they frequently had intheir expeditions by martial law, which we learn from Homer; for whenAgamemnon is affronted in council, he restrains his resentment, but whenhe is in the field and armed with this power, he tells the Greeks:  \"Whoe'er I know shall shun th' impending fight,   To dogs and vultures soon shall be a prey; For death is mine....\"This, then, is one species of monarchical government in which the kinglypower is in a general for life; and is sometimes hereditary, sometimeselective: besides, there is also another, which is to be met with amongsome of the barbarians, in which the kings are invested with powersnearly equal to a tyranny, yet are, in some respects, bound by the lawsand the customs of their country; for as the barbarians are by naturemore prone to slavery than the Greeks, and those in Asia more than thosein Europe, they endure without murmuring a despotic government; forthis reason their governments are tyrannies; but yet not liable to beoverthrown, as being customary and according to law. Their guards alsoare such as are used in a kingly government, not a despotic one; for theguards of their kings are his citizens, but a tyrant's are foreigners.The one commands, in the manner the law directs, those who willinglyobey; the other, arbitrarily, those who consent not. The one, therefore,is guarded by the citizens, the other against them.These, then, are the two different sorts of these monarchies, andanother is that which in ancient Greece they called _aesumnetes_; whichis nothing more than an elective tyranny; and its difference from thatwhich is to be found amongst the barbarians consists not in its notbeing according to law, but only in its not being according to theancient customs of the country. Some persons possessed this power forlife, others only for a particular time or particular purpose, as thepeople of Mitylene elected Pittacus to oppose the exiles, who wereheaded by Antimenides and Alcaeus the poet, as we learn from a poemof his; for he upbraids the Mitylenians for having chosen Pittacus fortheir tyrant, and with one [1285b] voice extolling him to the skies whowas the ruin of a rash and devoted people. These sorts of governmentthen are, and ever were, despotic, on account of their being tyrannies;but inasmuch as they are elective, and over a free people, they are alsokingly.A fourth species of kingly government is that which was in use in theheroic times, when a free people submitted to a kingly government,according to the laws and customs of their country. For those who wereat first of benefit to mankind, either in arts or arms, or by collectingthem into civil society, or procuring them an establishment, became thekings of a willing people, and established an hereditary monarchy.They were particularly their generals in war, and presided over theirsacrifices, excepting such only as belonged to the priests: they werealso the supreme judges over the people; and in this case some of themtook an oath, others did not; they did, the form of swearing was bytheir sceptre held out.In ancient times the power of the kings extended to everythingwhatsoever, both civil, domestic, and foreign; but in after-times theyrelinquished some of their privileges, and others the people assumed, sothat, in some states, they left their kings only the right of presidingover the sacrifices; and even those whom it were worth while to callby that name had only the right of being commander-in-chief in theirforeign wars.These, then, are the four sorts of kingdoms: the first is that of theheroic times; which was a government over a free people, with its rightsin some particulars marked out; for the king was their general, theirjudge, and their high priest. The second, that of the barbarians; whichis an hereditary despotic government regulated by laws: the third isthat which they call aesumnetic, which is an elective tyranny. Thefourth is the Lacedaemonian; and this, in few words, is nothing morethan an hereditary generalship: and in these particulars they differfrom each other. There is a fifth species of kingly government, which iswhen one person has a supreme power over all things whatsoever, inthe manner that every state and every city has over those things whichbelong to the public: for as the master of a family is king in his ownhouse, so such a king is master of a family in his own city or state.CHAPTER XVBut the different sorts of kingly governments may, if I may so say,be reduced to two; which we will consider more particularly. The lastspoken of, and the Lacedaemonian, for the chief of the others are placedbetween these, which are as it were at the extremities, they having lesspower than an absolute government, and yet more than the Lacedaemonians;so that the whole matter in question may be reduced to these two points;the one is, whether it is advantageous to the citizens to have theoffice of general continue in one person for life, and whether it shouldbe confined to any particular families or whether every one should beeligible: the other, whether [1286a] it is advantageous for one personto have the supreme power over everything or not. But to enter into theparticulars concerning the office of a Lacedaemonian general would berather to frame laws for a state than to consider the nature and utilityof its constitution, since we know that the appointing of a general iswhat is done in every state. Passing over this question then, we willproceed to consider the other part of their government, which isthe polity of the state; and this it will be necessary to examineparticularly into, and to go through such questions as may arise.Now the first thing which presents itself to our consideration is this,whether it is best to be governed by a good man, or by good laws? Thosewho prefer a kingly government think that laws can only speak a generallanguage, but cannot adapt themselves to particular circumstances; forwhich reason it is absurd in any science to follow written rule; andeven in Egypt the physician was allowed to alter the mode of cure whichthe law prescribed to him, after the fourth day; but if he did it soonerit was at his own peril: from whence it is evident, on the very sameaccount, that a government of written laws is not the best; and yetgeneral reasoning is necessary to all those who are to govern, and itwill be much more perfect in those who are entirely free from passionsthan in those to whom they are natural. But now this is a quality whichlaws possess; while the other is natural to the human soul. But someone will say in answer to this, that man will be a better judge ofparticulars. It will be necessary, then, for a king to be a lawgiver,and that his laws should be published, but that those should have noauthority which are absurd, as those which are not, should. But whetheris it better for the community that those things which cannot possiblycome under the cognisance of the law either at all or properly should beunder the government of every worthy citizen, as the present method is,when the public community, in their general assemblies, act as judgesand counsellors, where all their determinations are upon particularcases, for one individual, be he who he will, will be found, uponcomparison, inferior to a whole people taken collectively: but thisis what a city is, as a public entertainment is better than one man'sportion: for this reason the multitude judge of many things better thanany one single person. They are also less liable to corruption fromtheir numbers, as water is from its quantity: besides, the judgment ofan individual must necessarily be perverted if he is overcome by angeror any other passion; but it would be hard indeed if the whole communityshould be misled by anger. Moreover, let the people be free, and theywill do nothing but in conformity to the law, except only in those caseswhich the law cannot speak to. But though what I am going to propose maynot easily be met with, yet if the majority of the state should happento be good men, should they prefer one uncorrupt governor or manyequally good, is it not evident that they should choose the many? Butthere may be divisions among [1286b] these which cannot happen whenthere is but one. In answer to this it may be replied that all theirsouls will be as much animated with virtue as this one man's.If then a government of many, and all of them good men, compose anaristocracy, and the government of one a kingly power, it is evidentthat the people should rather choose the first than the last; and thiswhether the state is powerful or not, if many such persons so alikecan be met with: and for this reason probable it was, that the firstgovernments were generally monarchies; because it was difficult to finda number of persons eminently virtuous, more particularly as the worldwas then divided into small communities; besides, kings were appointedin return for the benefits they had conferred on mankind; but suchactions are peculiar to good men: but when many persons equal in virtueappeared at the time, they brooked not a superiority, but sought afteran equality and established a free state; but after this, when theydegenerated, they made a property of the public; which probably gaverise to oligarchies; for they made wealth meritorious, and the honoursof government were reserved for the rich: and these afterwards turnedto tyrannies and these in their turn gave rise to democracies; forthe power of the tyrants continually decreasing, on account of theirrapacious avarice, the people grew powerful enough to frame andestablish democracies: and as cities after that happened to increase,probably it was not easy for them to be under any other government thana democracy. But if any person prefers a kingly government in a state,what is to be done with the king's children? Is the family also toreign? But should they have such children as some persons usually have,it will be very detrimental. It may be said, that then the king whohas it in his power will never permit such children to succeed to hiskingdom. But it is not easy to trust to that; for it is very hard andrequires greater virtue than is to be met with in human nature. There isalso a doubt concerning the power with which a king should be entrusted:whether he should be allowed force sufficient to compel those who donot choose to be obedient to the laws, and how he is to support hisgovernment? for if he is to govern according to law and do nothing ofhis own will which is contrary thereunto, at the same time it willbe necessary to protect that power with which he guards the law, Thismatter however may not be very difficult to determine; for he ought tohave a proper power, and such a one is that which will be sufficientto make the king superior to any one person or even a large part of thecommunity, but inferior to the whole, as the ancients always appointedguards for that person whom they created aesumnetes or tyrant; and someone advised the Syracusians, when Dionysius asked for guards, to allowhim such.CHAPTER XVI[1287a] We will next consider the absolute monarch that we have justmentioned, who does everything according to his own will: for a kinggoverning under the direction of laws which he is obliged to follow doesnot of himself create any particular species of government, as we havealready said: for in every state whatsoever, either aristocracy ordemocracy, it is easy to appoint a general for life; and there are manywho entrust the administration of affairs to one person only; such isthe government at Dyrrachium, and nearly the same at Opus. As for anabsolute monarchy as it is called, that is to say, when the whole stateis wholly subject to the will of one person, namely the king, it seemsto many that it is unnatural that one man should have the entire ruleover his fellow-citizens when the state consists of equals: for naturerequires that the same right and the same rank should necessarily takeplace amongst all those who are equal by nature: for as it would behurtful to the body for those who are of different constitutions toobserve the same regimen, either of diet or clothing, so is it withrespect to the honours of the state as hurtful, that those who are equalin merit should be unequal in rank; for which reason it is as mucha man's duty to submit to command as to assume it, and this also byrotation; for this is law, for order is law; and it is more proper thatlaw should govern than any one of the citizens: upon the same principle,if it is advantageous to place the supreme power in some particularpersons, they should be appointed to be only guardians, and the servantsof the laws, for the supreme power must be placed somewhere; but theysay, that it is unjust that where all are equal one person shouldcontinually enjoy it. But it seems unlikely that man should be able toadjust that which the law cannot determine; it may be replied, that thelaw having laid down the best rules possible, leaves the adjustment andapplication of particulars to the discretion of the magistrate; besides,it allows anything to be altered which experience proves may be betterestablished. Moreover, he who would place the supreme power in mind,would place it in God and the laws; but he who entrusts man with it,gives it to a wild beast, for such his appetites sometimes make him; forpassion influences those who are in power, even the very best of men:for which reason law is reason without desire.The instance taken from the arts seems fallacious: wherein it is said tobe wrong for a sick person to apply for a remedy to books, but that itwould be far more eligible to employ those who are skilful in physic;for these do nothing contrary to reason from motives of friendshipbut earn their money by curing the sick, whereas those who have themanagement of public affairs do many things through hatred or favour.And, as a proof of what we have advanced, it may be observed, thatwhenever a sick person suspects that his physician has been persuaded byhis enemies to be guilty of any foul practice to him in his profession,he then rather chooses to apply to books for his cure: and not only this[1287b] but even physicians themselves when they are ill call in otherphysicians: and those who teach others the gymnastic exercises,exercise with those of the same profession, as being incapable fromself-partiality to form a proper judgment of what concerns themselves.From whence it is evident, that those who seek for what is just, seekfor a mean; now law is a mean. Moreover; the moral law is far superiorand conversant with far superior objects than the written law; for thesupreme magistrate is safer to be trusted to than the one, though he isinferior to the other. But as it is impossible that one person shouldhave an eye to everything himself, it will be necessary that the suprememagistrate should employ several subordinate ones under him; why thenshould not this be done at first, instead of appointing one person inthis manner? Besides, if, according to what has been already said, theman of worth is on that account fit to govern, two men of worth arecertainly better than one: as, for instance, in Homer, \"Let two togethergo:\" and also Agamemnon's wish; \"Were ten such faithful counsel mine!\"Not but that there are even now some particular magistrates investedwith supreme power to decide, as judges, those things which the lawcannot, as being one of those cases which comes not properly under itsjurisdiction; for of those which can there is no doubt: since then lawscomprehend some things, but not all, it is necessary to enquire andconsider which of the two is preferable, that the best man or the bestlaw should govern; for to reduce every subject which can come under thedeliberation of man into a law is impossible.No one then denies, that it is necessary that there should be someperson to decide those cases which cannot come under the cognisance ofa written law: but we say, that it is better to have many than one;for though every one who decides according to the principles of the lawdecides justly; yet surely it seems absurd to suppose, that one personcan see better with two eyes, and hear better with two ears, or dobetter with two hands and two feet, than many can do with many: for wesee that absolute monarchs now furnish themselves with many eyes andears and hands and feet; for they entrust those who are friends tothem and their government with part of their power; for if they are notfriends to the monarch, they will not do what he chooses; but if theyare friends to him, they are friends also to his government: but afriend is an equal and like his friend: if then he thinks that suchshould govern, he thinks that his equal also should govern. These arenearly the objections which are usually made to a kingly power.CHAPTER XVIIProbably what we have said may be true of some persons, but not ofothers; for some men are by nature formed to be under the government ofa master; others, of a king; others, to be the citizens of a free state,just and useful; but a tyranny is not according to nature, nor the otherperverted forms of government; for they are contrary to it. But itis evident from what has been said, that among equals it is neitheradvantageous nor [1288a] right that one person should be lord over allwhere there are no established laws, but his will is the law; or wherethere are; nor is it right that one who is good should have it overthose who are good; or one who is not good over those who are not good;nor one who is superior to the rest in worth, except in a particularmanner, which shall be described, though indeed it has been alreadymentioned. But let us next determine what people are best qualifiedfor a kingly government, what for an aristocratic, and what for ademocratic. And, first, for a kingly; and it should be those who areaccustomed by nature to submit the civil government of themselves to afamily eminent for virtue: for an aristocracy, those who are naturallyframed to bear the rule of free men, whose superior virtue makes themworthy of the management of others: for a free state, a war-like people,formed by nature both to govern and be governed by laws which admit thepoorest citizen to share the honours of the commonwealth accordingto his worth. But whenever a whole family or any one of another shallhappen so far to excel in virtue as to exceed all other persons in thecommunity, then it is right that the kingly power should be in them, orif it is an individual who does so, that he should be king and lord ofall; for this, as we have just mentioned, is not only correspondentto that principle of right which all founders of all states, whetheraristocracies, oligarchies, or democracies, have a regard to (forin placing the supreme power they all think it right to fix it toexcellence, though not the same); but it is also agreeable to whathas been already said; as it would not be right to kill, or banish, orostracise such a one for his superior merit. Nor would it be properto let him have the supreme power only in turn; for it is contrary tonature that what is highest should ever be lowest: but this would bethe case should such a one ever be governed by others. So that there cannothing else be done but to submit, and permit him continually toenjoy the supreme power. And thus much with respect to kingly power indifferent states, and whether it is or is not advantageous to them, andto what, and in what manner.CHAPTER XVIIISince then we have said that there are three sorts of regulargovernments, and of these the best must necessarily be that which isadministered by the best men (and this must be that which happens tohave one man, or one family, or a number of persons excelling all therest in virtue, who are able to govern and be governed in such a manneras will make life most agreeable, and we have already shown that thevirtue of a good man and of a citizen in the most perfect governmentwill be the same), it is evident, that in the same manner, and for thosevery qualities which would procure a man the character of good, anyone would say, that the government of a state was a well-establishedaristocracy or kingdom; so that it will be found to be education and[1288b] morals that are almost the whole which go to make a good man,and the same qualities will make a good citizen or good king.These particulars being treated of, we will now proceed to considerwhat sort of government is best, how it naturally arises, and how itis established; for it is necessary to make a proper inquiry concerningthis.BOOK IVIn every art and science which is not conversant in parts but in someone genus in which it is complete, it is the business of that art aloneto determine what is fitted to its particular genus; as what particularexercise is fitted to a certain particular body, and suits it best: forthat body which is formed by nature the most perfect and superior toothers necessarily requires the best exercise-and also of what one kindthat must be which will suit the generality; and this is the business ofthe gymnastic arts: and although any one should not desire to acquirean exact knowledge and skill in these exercises, yet it is not, on thataccount, the less necessary that he who professes to be a master andinstruct the youth in them should be perfect therein: and we see thatthis is what equally befalls the healing, shipbuilding, cloth-making,and indeed all other arts; so that it evidently belongs to the same artto find out what kind of government is best, and would of all others bemost correspondent to our wish, while it received no molestation fromwithout: and what particular species of it is adapted to particularpersons; for there are many who probably are incapable of enjoying thebest form: so that the legislator, and he who is truly a politician,ought to be acquainted not only with that which is most perfectimaginable, but also that which is the best suited to any givencircumstances. There is, moreover, a third sort, an imaginary one, andhe ought, if such a one should be presented to his consideration, to beable to discern what sort of one it would be at the beginning; and, whenonce established, what would be the proper means to preserve it a longtime. I mean, for instance, if a state should happen not to have thebest form of government, or be deficient in what was necessary, or notreceive every advantage possible, but something less. And, besides allthis, it is necessary to know what sort of government is best fittingfor all cities: for most of those writers who have treated this subject,however speciously they may handle other parts of it, have failed indescribing the practical parts: for it is not enough to be able toperceive what is best without it is what can be put in practice. Itshould also be simple, and easy for all to attain to. But some seek onlythe most subtile forms of government. Others again, choosing [1289a]rather to treat of what is common, censure those under which they live,and extol the excellence of a particular state, as the Lacedaemonian,or some other: but every legislator ought to establish such a form ofgovernment as from the present state and disposition of the people whoare to receive it they will most readily submit to and persuade thecommunity to partake of: for it is not a business of less trouble tocorrect the mistakes of an established government than to form a newone; as it is as difficult to recover what we have forgot as to learnanything afresh. He, therefore, who aspires to the character of alegislator, ought, besides all we have already said, to be able tocorrect the mistakes of a government already established, as we havebefore mentioned. But this is impossible to be done by him who doesnot know how many different forms of government there are: some personsthink that there is only one species both of democracy and oligarchy;but this is not true: so that every one should be acquainted with thedifference of these governments, how great they are, and whence theyarise; and should have equal knowledge to perceive what laws are best,and what are most suitable to each particular government: for alllaws are, and ought to be, framed agreeable to the state that is to begoverned by them, and not the state to the laws: for government is acertain ordering in a state which particularly respects the magistratesin what manner they shall be regulated, and where the supreme powershall be placed; and what shall be the final object which each communityshall have in view; but the laws are something different from whatregulates and expresses the form of the constitution-it is their officeto direct the conduct of the magistrate in the execution of his officeand the punishment of offenders. From whence it is evident, that thefounders of laws should attend both to the number and the differentsorts of government; for it is impossible that the same laws should becalculated for all sorts of oligarchies and all sorts of democracies,for of both these governments there are many species, not one only.ISince, then, according to our first method in treating of the differentforms of government, we have divided those which are regular into threesorts, the kingly, the aristocratical, the free states, and shownthe three excesses which these are liable to: the kingly, of becomingtyrannical; the aristocratical, oligarchical; and the free state,democratical: and as we have already treated of the aristocratical andkingly; for to enter into an inquiry what sort of government is bestis the same thing as to treat of these two expressly; for each ofthem desires to be established upon the principles of virtue: and as,moreover, we have already determined wherein a kingly power and anaristocracy differ from each other, and when a state may be said to begoverned by a king, it now remains that we examine into a free state,and also these other governments, an oligarchy, a democracy, and a[1289b] tyranny; and it is evident of these three excesses which must bethe worst of all, and which next to it; for, of course, the excesses ofthe best and most holy must be the worst; for it must necessarily happeneither that the name of king only will remain, or else that the kingwill assume more power than belongs to him, from whence tyranny willarise, the worst excess imaginable, a government the most contrarypossible to a free state. The excess next hurtful is an oligarchy; foran aristocracy differs much from this sort of government: that which isleast so is a democracy. This subject has been already treated of by oneof those writers who have gone before me, though his sentiments are notthe same as mine: for he thought, that of all excellent constitutions,as a good oligarchy or the like, a democracy was the worst, but of allbad ones, the best.Now I affirm, that all these states have, without exception, fallen intoexcess; and also that he should not have said that one oligarchy wasbetter than another, but that it was not quite so bad. But this questionwe shall not enter into at present. We shall first inquire how manydifferent sorts of free states there are; since there are manyspecies of democracies and oligarchies; and which of them is the mostcomprehensive, and most desirable after the best form of government; orif there is any other like an aristocracy, well established; and alsowhich of these is best adapted to most cities, and which of them ispreferable for particular persons: for, probably, some may suit betterwith an oligarchy than a democracy, and others better with a democracythan an oligarchy; and afterwards in what manner any one ought toproceed who desires to establish either of these states, I mean everyspecies of democracy, and also of oligarchy. And to conclude, when weshall have briefly gone through everything that is necessary, we willendeavour to point out the sources of corruption, and stability, ingovernment, as well those which are common to all as those which arepeculiar to each state, and from what causes they chiefly arise.IIThe reason for there being many different sorts of governments is this,that each state consists of a great number of parts; for, in the firstplace, we see that all cities are made up of families: and again, ofthe multitude of these some must be rich, some poor, and others in themiddle station; and that, both of the rich and poor, some will be usedto arms, others not. We see also, that some of the common people arehusbandmen, others attend the market, and others are artificers. Thereis also a difference between the nobles in their wealth, and the dignityin which they live: for instance, in the number of horses they breed;for this cannot be supported without a large fortune: for which reason,in former times, those cities whose strength consisted in horse becameby that means oligarchies; and they used horse in their expeditionsagainst the neighbouring cities; as the Eretrians the Chalcidians, theMagnetians, who lived near the river Meander, and many others in Asia.Moreover, besides the difference of fortune, there is that which arisesfrom family and merit; or, if there are any other distinctions [1290a]which make part of the city, they have been already mentioned intreating of an aristocracy, for there we considered how many parts eachcity must necessarily be composed of; and sometimes each of these have ashare in the government, sometimes a few, sometimes more.It is evident then, that there must be many forms of government,differing from each other in their particular constitution: for theparts of which they are composed each differ from the other. Forgovernment is the ordering of the magistracies of the state; and thesethe community share between themselves, either as they can attain themby force, or according to some common equality which there is amongstthem, as poverty, wealth, or something which they both partake of. Theremust therefore necessarily be as many different forms of governments asthere are different ranks in the society, arising from the superiorityof some over others, and their different situations. And these seemchiefly to be two, as they say, of the winds: namely, the north andthe south; and all the others are declinations from these. And thus inpolitics, there is the government of the many and the government ofthe few; or a democracy and an oligarchy: for an aristocracy may beconsidered as a species of oligarchy, as being also a government of thefew; and what we call a free state may be considered as a democracy: asin the winds they consider the west as part of the north, and the eastas part of the south: and thus it is in music, according to some, whosay there are only two species of it, the Doric and the Phrygian, andall other species of composition they call after one of these names; andmany people are accustomed to consider the nature of government in thesame light; but it is both more convenient and more correspondent totruth to distinguish governments as I have done, into two species: one,of those which are established upon proper principles; of which theremay be one or two sorts: the other, which includes all the differentexcesses of these; so that we may compare the best form of government tothe most harmonious piece of music; the oligarchic and despotic to themore violent tunes; and the democratic to the soft and gentle airs.VWe ought not to define a democracy as some do, who say simply, that itis a government where the supreme power is lodged in the people; foreven in oligarchies the supreme power is in the majority. Nor shouldthey define an oligarchy a government where the supreme power is in thehands of a few: for let us suppose the number of a people to be thirteenhundred, and that of these one thousand were rich, who would not permitthe three hundred poor to have any share in the government, althoughthey were free, and their equal in everything else; no one would say,that this government was a democracy. In like manner, if the poor, whenfew in number, should acquire the power over the rich, though more thanthemselves, no one would say, that this was an oligarchy; nor this, whenthe rest who are rich have no share in the administration. We shouldrather say, that a democracy is when the supreme power is in the [1290b]hands of the freemen; an oligarchy, when it is in the hands of the rich:it happens indeed that in the one case the many will possess it, inthe other the few; because there are many poor and few rich. And if thepower of the state was to be distributed according to the size of thecitizens, as they say it is in Ethiopia, or according to their beauty,it would be an oligarchy: for the number of those who are large andbeautiful is small.Nor are those things which we have already mentioned alone sufficientto describe these states; for since there are many species both of ademocracy and an oligarchy, the matter requires further consideration;as we cannot admit, that if a few persons who are free possess thesupreme power over the many who are not free, that this government is ademocracy: as in Apollonia, in Ionia, and in Thera: for in each of thesecities the honours of the state belong to some few particular families,who first founded the colonies. Nor would the rich, because they aresuperior in numbers, form a democracy, as formerly at Colophon; forthere the majority had large possessions before the Lydian war: but ademocracy is a state where the freemen and the poor, being the majority,are invested with the power of the state. An oligarchy is a state wherethe rich and those of noble families, being few, possess it.We have now proved that there are various forms of government and haveassigned a reason for it; and shall proceed to show that there areeven more than these, and what they are, and why; setting out with theprinciple we have already laid down. We admit that every city consistsnot of one, but many parts: thus, if we should endeavour to comprehendthe different species of animals we should first of all note those partswhich every animal must have, as a certain sensorium, and also what isnecessary to acquire and retain food, as a mouth and a belly; besidescertain parts to enable it to move from place to place. If, then, theseare the only parts of an animal and there are differences between them;namely, in their various sorts of stomachs, bellies, and sensoriums: towhich we must add their motive powers; the number of the combinations ofall these must necessarily make up the different species of animals.For it is not possible that the same kind of animal should have anyvery great difference in its mouth or ears; so that when all these arecollected, who happen to have these things similar in all, they make upa species of animals of which there are as many as there are of thesegeneral combinations of necessary parts.The same thing is true of what are called states; for a city is not madeof one but many parts, as has already been often said; one of which isthose who supply it with provisions, called husbandmen, another calledmechanics, [1291a] whose employment is in the manual arts, without whichthe city could not be inhabited; of these some are busied about what isabsolutely necessary, others in what contribute to the elegancies andpleasures of life; the third sort are your exchange-men, I mean by theseyour buyers, sellers, merchants, and victuallers; the fourth are yourhired labourers or workmen; the fifth are the men-at-arms, a rank notless useful than the other, without you would have the community slavesto every invader; but what cannot defend itself is unworthy of the nameof a city; for a city is self-sufficient, a slave not. So that whenSocrates, in Plato's Republic, says that a city is necessarily composedof four sorts of people, he speaks elegantly but not correctly, andthese are, according to him, weavers, husbandmen, shoe-makers, andbuilders; he then adds, as if these were not sufficient, smiths,herdsmen for what cattle are necessary, and also merchants andvictuallers, and these are by way of appendix to his first list; as ifa city was established for necessity, and not happiness, or as if ashoe-maker and a husbandman were equally useful. He reckons not themilitary a part before the increase of territory and joining to theborders of the neighbouring powers will make war necessary: and evenamongst them who compose his four divisions, or whoever have anyconnection with each other, it will be necessary to have some one todistribute justice, and determine between man and man. If, then, themind is a more valuable part of man than the body, every one wouldwish to have those things more regarded in his city which tend to theadvantage of these than common matters, such are war and justice; towhich may be added council, which is the business of civil wisdom (noris it of any consequence whether these different employments are filledby different persons or one, as the same man is oftentimes both asoldier and a husbandman): so that if both the judge and the senator areparts of the city, it necessarily follows that the soldier must beso also. The seventh sort are those who serve the public in expensiveemployments at their own charge: these are called the rich. The eighthare those who execute the different offices of the state, and withoutthese it could not possibly subsist: it is therefore necessary thatthere should be some persons capable of governing and filling the placesin the city; and this either for life or in rotation: the office ofsenator, and judge, of which we have already sufficiently treated, arethe only ones remaining. If, then, these things are necessary for astate, that it may be happy and just, it follows that the citizens whoengage in public affairs should be men of abilities therein. [1291b]Several persons think, that different employments may be allotted to thesame person; as a soldier's, a husbandman's, and an artificer's; as alsothat others may be both senators and judges.Besides, every one supposes himself a man of political abilities, andthat he is qualified for almost every department in the state. But thesame person cannot at once be poor and rich: for which reason the mostobvious division of the city is into two parts, the poor and rich;moreover, since for the generality the one are few, the other many, theyseem of all the parts of a city most contrary to each other; so that asthe one or the other prevail they form different states; and these arethe democracy and the oligarchy.But that there are many different states, and from what causes theyarise, has been already mentioned: and that there are also differentspecies both of democracies and oligarchies we will now show. Thoughthis indeed is evident from what we have already said: there are alsomany different sorts of common people, and also of those who arecalled gentlemen. Of the different sorts of the first are husbandmen,artificers, exchange-men, who are employed in buying and selling,seamen, of which some are engaged in war, some in traffic, some incarrying goods and passengers from place to place, others in fishing,and of each of these there are often many, as fishermen at Tarentum andByzantium, masters of galleys at Athens, merchants at AEgina and Chios,those who let ships on freight at Tenedos; we may add to these those wholive by their manual labour and have but little property; so that theycannot live without some employ: and also those who are not free-bornon both sides, and whatever other sort of common people there may be.As for gentlemen, they are such as are distinguished either by theirfortune, their birth, their abilities, or their education, or anysuch-like excellence which is attributed to them.The most pure democracy is that which is so called principally from thatequality which prevails in it: for this is what the law in that statedirects; that the poor shall be in no greater subjection than the rich;nor that the supreme power shall be lodged with either of these, butthat both shall share it. For if liberty and equality, as some personssuppose, are chiefly to be found in a democracy, it must be most soby every department of government being alike open to all; but as thepeople are the majority, and what they vote is law, it follows that sucha state must be a democracy. This, then, is one species thereof. Anotheris, when the magistrates are elected by a certain census; but thisshould be but small, and every one who was included in it should beeligible, but as soon as he was below it should lose that right. [1292a]Another sort is, in which every citizen who is not infamous has a sharein the government, but where the government is in the laws. Another,where every citizen without exception has this right. Another is likethese in other particulars, but there the people govern, and not thelaw: and this takes place when everything is determined by a majority ofvotes, and not by a law; which happens when the people are influenced bythe demagogues: for where a democracy is governed by stated laws thereis no room for them, but men of worth fill the first offices in thestate: but where the power is not vested in the laws, there demagoguesabound: for there the people rule with kingly power: the whole composingone body; for they are supreme, not as individuals but in theircollective capacity.Homer also discommends the government of many; but whether he means thiswe are speaking of, or where each person exercises his power separately,is uncertain. When the people possess this power they desire to bealtogether absolute, that they may not be under the control of the law,and this is the time when flatterers are held in repute. Nor is thereany difference between such a people and monarchs in a tyranny: fortheir manners are the same, and they both hold a despotic power overbetter persons than themselves. For their decrees are like the others'edicts; their demagogues like the others' flatterers: but their greatestresemblance consists in the mutual support they give to each other, theflatterer to the tyrant, the demagogue to the people: and to them it isowing that the supreme power is lodged in the votes of the people,and not in the laws; for they bring everything before them, as theirinfluence is owing to their being supreme whose opinions they entirelydirect; for these are they whom the multitude obey. Besides, those whoaccuse the magistrates insist upon it, that the right of determining ontheir conduct lies in the people, who gladly receive their complaints asthe means of destroying all their offices.Any one, therefore, may with great justice blame such a government asbeing a democracy, and not a free state; for where the government isnot in the laws, then there is no free state, for the law ought to besupreme over all things; and particular incidents which arise should bedetermined by the magistrates or the state. If, therefore, ademocracy is to be reckoned a free state, it is evident that any suchestablishment which centres all power in the votes of the people cannot,properly speaking, be a democracy: for their decrees cannot be generalin their extent. Thus, then, we may describe the several species ofdemocracies.CHAPTER VOf the different species of oligarchies one is, when the right to theoffices is regulated by a certain census; so that the poor, although themajority, have no share in it; while all those who are included thereintake part in the management of public affairs. Another sort is, when[1292b] the magistrates are men of very small fortune, who upon anyvacancy do themselves fill it up: and if they do this out of thecommunity at large, the state approaches to an aristocracy; if out ofany particular class of people, it will be an oligarchy. Another sort ofoligarchy is, when the power is an hereditary nobility. The fourth is,when the power is in the same hands as the other, but not under thecontrol of law; and this sort of oligarchy exactly corresponds to atyranny in monarchies, and to that particular species of democracieswhich I last mentioned in treating of that state: this has theparticular name of a dynasty. These are the different sorts ofoligarchies and democracies.It should also be known, that it often happens that a free state, wherethe supreme power is in the laws, may not be democratic, and yet inconsequence of the established manners and customs of the people, maybe governed as if it was; so, on the other hand, where the laws maycountenance a more democratic form of government, these may make thestate inclining to an oligarchy; and this chiefly happens when therehas been any alteration in the government; for the people do not easilychange, but love their own ancient customs; and it is by small degreesonly that one thing takes place of another; so that the ancient lawswill remain, while the power will be in the hands of those who havebrought about a revolution in the state.CHAPTER VIIt is evident from what has been said, that there are as many differentsorts of democracies and oligarchies as I have reckoned up: for, ofnecessity, either all ranks of the people which I have enumerated musthave a share in the government, or some only, and others not; for whenthe husbandmen, and those only who possess moderate fortunes, have thesupreme power, they will govern according to law; for as they must gettheir livings by their employs, they have but little leisure for publicbusiness: they will therefore establish proper laws, and never callpublic assemblies but when there is a necessity for them; and they willreadily let every one partake with them in the administration of publicaffairs as soon as they possess that fortune which the law requires fortheir qualification: every one, therefore, who is qualified will havehis share in the government: for to exclude any would be to make thegovernment an oligarchy, and for all to have leisure to attendwithout they had a subsistence would be impossible: for these reasons,therefore, this government is a species of democracy. Another species isdistinguished by the mode of electing their magistrates, in which everyone is eligible, to whose birth there are no objections, provided he issupposed to have leisure to attend: for which reason in such a democracythe supreme power will be vested in the laws, as there will be nothingpaid to those who go to the public assemblies. A third species is whereevery freeman has a right to a share in the government, which he willnot accept for the cause already assigned; for which reason here alsothe supreme power will be in the law. The fourth species [1293a] ofdemocracy, the last which was established in order of time, arose whencities were greatly enlarged to what they were at first, and when thepublic revenue became something considerable; for then the populace, onaccount of their numbers, were admitted to share in the management ofpublic affairs, for then even the poorest people were at leisure toattend to them, as they received wages for so doing; nay, they were moreso than others, as they were not hindered by having anything of theirown to mind, as the rich had; for which reason these last very often didnot frequent the public assemblies and the courts of justice: thus thesupreme power was lodged in the poor, and not in the laws. These arethe different sorts of democracies, and such are the causes whichnecessarily gave birth to them.The first species of oligarchy is, when the generality of the state aremen of moderate and not too large property; for this gives them leisurefor the management of public affairs: and, as they are a numerous body,it necessarily follows that the supreme power must be in the laws, andnot in men; for as they are far removed from a monarchical government,and have not sufficient fortune to neglect their private affairs, whilethey are too many to be supported by the public, they will of coursedetermine to be governed by the laws, and not by each other. But if themen of property in the state are but few, and their property is large,then an oligarchy of the second sort will take place; for those who havemost power will think that they have a right to lord it over the others;and, to accomplish this, they will associate to themselves some who havean inclination for public affairs, and as they are not powerful enoughto govern without law, they will make a law for that purpose. And ifthose few who have large fortunes should acquire still greater power,the oligarchy will then alter into one of the third sort; for they willget all the offices of the state into their own hands by a law whichdirects the son to succeed upon the death of his father; and,after that, when, by means of their increasing wealth and powerfulconnections, they extend still further their oppression, a monarchicaldynasty will directly succeed wherein men will be supreme, and not thelaw; and this is the fourth species of an oligarchy correspondent to thelast-mentioned class of democracies.CHAPTER VIIThere are besides two other states, a democracy and an oligarchy, oneof which all speak of, and it is always esteemed a species of thefour sorts; and thus they reckon them up; a monarchy, an oligarchy, ademocracy, and this fourth which they call an aristocracy. There isalso a fifth, which bears a name that is also common to the other four,namely, a state: but as this is seldom to be met with, it has escapedthose who have endeavoured to enumerate the different sorts ofgovernments, which [1293b] they fix at four only, as does Plato in hisRepublic.An aristocracy, of which I have already treated in the first book, isrightly called so; for a state governed by the best men, upon the mostvirtuous principles, and not upon any hypothesis, which even good menmay propose, has alone a right to be called an aristocracy, for it isthere only that a man is at once a good man and a good citizen; while inother states men are good only relative to those states. Moreover, thereare some other states which are called by the same name, that differboth from oligarchies and free states, wherein not only the rich butalso the virtuous have a share in the administration; and have thereforeacquired the name of aristocracies; for in those governments whereinvirtue is not their common care, there are still men of worth andapproved goodness. Whatever state, then, like the Carthaginians,favours the rich, the virtuous, and the citizens at large, is a sortof aristocracy: when only the two latter are held in esteem, as atLacedaemon, and the state is jointly composed of these, it is a virtuousdemocracy. These are the two species of aristocracies after the first,which is the best of all governments. There is also a third, which is,whenever a free state inclines to the dominion of a few.CHAPTER VIIIIt now remains for us to treat of that government which is particularlycalled a free state, and also of a tyranny; and the reason for mychoosing to place that free state here is, because this, as wellas those aristocracies already mentioned, although they do not seemexcesses, yet, to speak true, they have all departed from what a perfectgovernment is. Nay, they are deviations both of them equally from otherforms, as I said at the beginning. It is proper to mention a tyranny thelast of all governments, for it is of all others the least like one:but as my intention is to treat of all governments in general, for thisreason that also, as I have said, will be taken into consideration inits proper place.I shall now inquire into a free state and show what it is; and we shallthe better understand its positive nature as we have already describedan oligarchy and a democracy; for a free state is indeed nothing morethan a mixture of them, and it has been usual to call those whichincline most to a democracy, a free state; those which incline most toan oligarchy, an aristocracy, because those who are rich are generallymen of family and education; besides, they enjoy those things whichothers are often guilty of crimes to procure: for which reason they areregarded as men of worth and honour and note.Since, then, it is the genius of an aristocracy to allot the largerpart of the government to the best citizens, they therefore say, thatan oligarchy is chiefly composed of those men who are worthy andhonourable: now it [1294a] seems impossible that where the governmentis in the hands of the good, there the laws should not be good, but bad;or, on the contrary, that where the government is in the hands of thebad, there the laws should be good; nor is a government well constitutedbecause the laws are, without at the same time care is taken that theyare observed; for to enforce obedience to the laws which it makes is oneproof of a good constitution in the state-another is, to have laws wellcalculated for those who are to abide by them; for if they are improperthey must be obeyed: and this may be done two ways, either by theirbeing the best relative to the particular state, or the best absolutely.An aristocracy seems most likely to confer the honours of the state onthe virtuous; for virtue is the object of an aristocracy, riches of anoligarchy, and liberty of a democracy; for what is approved of by themajority will prevail in all or in each of these three different states;and that which seems good to most of those who compose the communitywill prevail: for what is called a state prevails in many communities,which aim at a mixture of rich and poor, riches and liberty: as forthe rich, they are usually supposed to take the place of the worthy andhonourable. As there are three things which claim an equal rank in thestate, freedom, riches, and virtue (for as for the fourth, rank, it isan attendant on two of the others, for virtue and riches are the originof family), it is evident, that the conjuncture of the rich and the poormake up a free state; but that all three tend to an aristocracy morethan any other, except that which is truly so, which holds the firstrank.We have already seen that there are governments different from amonarchy, a democracy, and an oligarchy; and what they are, and whereinthey differ from each other; and also aristocracies and states properlyso called, which are derived from them; and it is evident that these arenot much unlike each other.XWe shall next proceed to show how that government which is peculiarlycalled a state arises alongside of democracy and oligarchy, and how itought to be established; and this will at the same time show what arethe proper boundaries of both these governments, for we must mark outwherein they differ from one another, and then from both these composea state of such parts of each of them as will show from whence they weretaken.There are three different ways in which two states may be blended andjoined together; for, in the first place, all those rules may be adoptedwhich the laws of each of them have ordered; as for instance in thejudicial department, for in an oligarchy the rich are fined if they donot come to the court as jurymen, but the poor are not paid for theirattendance; but in democracies they are, while the rich are not finedfor their neglect. Now these things, as being common to both, are fitto be observed in a free [1294b] state which is composed of both. This,then, is one way in which they may be joined together. In the secondplace, a medium may be taken between the different methods which eachstate observes; for instance, in a democracy the right to vote in thepublic assembly is either confined by no census at all, or limited by avery small one; in an oligarchy none enjoy it but those whose census ishigh: therefore, as these two practices are contrary to each other, acensus between each may be established in such a state. In the thirdplace, different laws of each community may be adopted; as, forinstance, as it seems correspondent to the nature of a democracy, thatthe magistrates should be chosen by lot, but an aristocracy by vote, andin the one state according to a census, but not in the other: let, then,an aristocracy and a free state copy something from each of them; letthem follow an oligarchy in choosing their magistrates by vote, but ademocracy in not admitting of any census, and thus blend together thedifferent customs of the two governments. But the best proof of a happymixture of a democracy and an oligarchy is this, when a person mayproperly call the same state a democracy and an oligarchy. It is evidentthat those who speak of it in this manner are induced to it because boththese governments are there well blended together: and indeed thisis common to all mediums, that the extremes of each side should bediscerned therein, as at Lacedaemon; for many affirm that it is ademocracy from the many particulars in which it follows that form ofgovernment; as for instance, in the first place, in the bringing up oftheir children, for the rich and poor are brought up in the same manner;and their education is such that the children of the poor may partake ofit; and the same rules are observed when they are youths and men, thereis no distinction between a rich person and a poor one; and in theirpublic tables the same provision is served to all. The rich also wearonly such clothes as the poorest man is able to purchase. Moreover, withrespect to two magistracies of the highest rank, one they have a rightto elect to, the other to fill; namely, the senate and the ephori.Others consider it as an oligarchy, the principles of which it followsin many things, as in choosing all their officers by vote, and not bylot; in there being but a few who have a right to sit in judgment oncapital causes and the like. Indeed, a state which is well composed oftwo others ought to resemble them both, and neither, Such a state oughtto have its means of preservation in itself, and not without; and when Isay in itself, I do not mean that it should owe this to the forbearanceof their neighbours, for this may happen to a bad government, but toevery member of the community's not being willing that there should bethe least alteration in their constitution. Such is the method in whicha free state or aristocracy ought to be established.CHAPTER XIt now remains to treat of a tyranny; not that there is [1295a] muchto be said on that subject, but as it makes part of our plan, sincewe enumerated it amongst our different sorts of governments. In thebeginning of this work we inquired into the nature of kingly government,and entered into a particular examination of what was most properlycalled so, and whether it was advantageous to a state or not, and whatit should be, and how established; and we divided a tyranny into twopieces when we were upon this subject, because there is somethinganalogous between this and a kingly government, for they are both ofthem established by law; for among some of the barbarians they elect amonarch with absolute power, and formerly among the Greeks there weresome such, whom they called sesumnetes. Now these differ from eachother; for some possess only kingly power regulated by law, andrule those who voluntarily submit to their government; others ruledespotically according to their own will. There is a third species oftyranny, most properly so called, which is the very opposite to kinglypower; for this is the government of one who rules over his equals andsuperiors without being accountable for his conduct, and whose object ishis own advantage, and not the advantage of those he governs; for whichreason he rules by compulsion, for no freemen will ever willingly submitto such a government. These are the different species of tyrannies,their principles, and their causes.CHAPTER XIWe proceed now to inquire what form of government and what mannerof life is best for communities in general, not adapting it to thatsuperior virtue which is above the reach of the vulgar, or thateducation which every advantage of nature and fortune only can furnish,nor to those imaginary plans which may be formed at pleasure; but tothat mode of life which the greater part of mankind can attain to,and that government which most cities may establish: for as to thosearistocracies which we have now mentioned, they are either too perfectfor a state to support, or one so nearly alike to that state we nowgoing to inquire into, that we shall treat of them both as one.The opinions which we form upon these subjects must depend upon onecommon principle: for if what I have said in my treatise on Morals istrue, a happy life must arise from an uninterrupted course of virtue;and if virtue consists in a certain medium, the middle life mustcertainly be the happiest; which medium is attainable [1295b] byevery one. The boundaries of virtue and vice in the state must alsonecessarily be the same as in a private person; for the form ofgovernment is the life of the city. In every city the people are dividedinto three sorts; the very rich, the very poor, and those who arebetween them. If this is universally admitted, that the mean is best, itis evident that even in point of fortune mediocrity is to be preferred;for that state is most submissive to reason; for those who are veryhandsome, or very strong, or very noble, or very rich; or, on thecontrary; those who are very poor, or very weak, or very mean, withdifficulty obey it; for the one are capricious and greatly flagitious,the other rascally and mean, the crimes of each arising from theirdifferent excesses: nor will they go through the different officesof the state; which is detrimental to it: besides, those who excel instrength, in riches, or friends, or the like, neither know how nor arewilling to submit to command: and this begins at home when they areboys; for there they are brought up too delicately to be accustomed toobey their preceptors: as for the very poor, their general and excessivewant of what the rich enjoy reduces them to a state too mean: so thatthe one know not how to command, but to be commanded as slaves, theothers know not how to submit to any command, nor to command themselvesbut with despotic power.A city composed of such men must therefore consist of slaves andmasters, not freemen; where one party must hate, and the otherdespise, where there could be no possibility of friendship or politicalcommunity: for community supposes affection; for we do not even on theroad associate with our enemies. It is also the genius of a city to becomposed as much as possible of equals; which will be most so when theinhabitants are in the middle state: from whence it follows, that thatcity must be best framed which is composed of those whom we say arenaturally its proper members. It is men of this station also who will bebest assured of safety and protection; for they will neither covet whatbelongs to others, as the poor do; nor will others covet what is theirs,as the poor do what belongs to the rich; and thus, without plottingagainst any one, or having any one plot against them, they will livefree from danger: for which reason Phocylides wisely wishes for themiddle state, as being most productive of happiness. It is plain, then,that the most perfect political community must be amongst those who arein the middle rank, and those states are best instituted wherein theseare a larger and more respectable part, if possible, than both theother; or, if that cannot be, at least than either of them separate;so that being thrown into the balance it may prevent either scale frompreponderating.It is therefore the greatest happiness which the citizens can enjoy topossess a moderate and convenient fortune; for when some possess toomuch, and others nothing at [1296a] all, the government must either bein the hands of the meanest rabble or else a pure oligarchy; or, fromthe excesses of both, a tyranny; for this arises from a headstrongdemocracy or an oligarchy, but very seldom when the members of thecommunity are nearly on an equality with each other. We will assign areason for this when we come to treat of the alterations which differentstates are likely to undergo. The middle state is therefore best, asbeing least liable to those seditions and insurrections which disturbthe community; and for the same reason extensive governments are leastliable to these inconveniences; for there those in a middle state arevery numerous, whereas in small ones it is easy to pass to the twoextremes, so as hardly to have any in a medium remaining, but theone half rich, the other poor: and from the same principle it is thatdemocracies are more firmly established and of longer continuance thanoligarchies; but even in those when there is a want of a proper numberof men of middling fortune, the poor extend their power too far, abusesarise, and the government is soon at an end.We ought to consider as a proof of what I now advance, that the bestlawgivers themselves were those in the middle rank of life, amongst whomwas Solon, as is evident from his poems, and Lycurgus, for he was nota king, and Charondas, and indeed most others. What has been said willshow us why of so many free states some have changed to democracies,others to oligarchies: for whenever the number of those in the middlestate has been too small, those who were the more numerous, whether therich or the poor, always overpowered them and assumed to themselves theadministration of public affairs; from hence arose either a democracyor an oligarchy. Moreover, when in consequence of their disputes andquarrels with each other, either the rich get the better of the poor, orthe poor of the rich, neither of them will establish a free state;but, as the record of their victory, one which inclines to their ownprinciples, and form either a democracy or an oligarchy.Those who made conquests in Greece, having all of them an eye to therespective forms of government in their own cities, established eitherdemocracies or oligarchies, not considering what was serviceable to thestate, but what was similar to their own; for which reason a governmenthas never been established where the supreme power has been placedamongst those of the middling rank, or very seldom; and, amongst a few,one man only of those who have yet been conquerors has been persuadedto give the preference to this order of [1296b] men: it is indeed anestablished custom with the inhabitants of most cities not to desire anequality, but either to aspire to govern, or when they are conquered, tosubmit.Thus we have shown what the best state is, and why. It will not bedifficult to perceive of the many states which there are, for we haveseen that there are various forms both of democracies and oligarchies,to which we should give the first place, to which the second, and inthe same manner the next also; and to observe what are the particularexcellences and defects of each, after we have first described the bestpossible; for that must be the best which is nearest to this, that worstwhich is most distant from the medium, without any one has a particularplan of his own which he judges by. I mean by this, that it may happen,that although one form of government may be better than another, yetthere is no reason to prevent another from being preferable thereunto inparticular circumstances and for particular purposes.CHAPTER XIIAfter what has been said, it follows that we should now show whatparticular form of government is most suitable for particular persons;first laying this down as a general maxim, that that party which desiresto support the actual administration of the state ought always to besuperior to that which would alter it. Every city is made up of qualityand quantity: by quality I mean liberty, riches, education, and family,and by quantity its relative populousness: now it may happen thatquality may exist in one of those parts of which the city is composed,and quantity in another; thus the number of the ignoble may be greaterthan the number of those of family, the number of the poor than that ofthe rich; but not so that the quantity of the one shall overbalance thequality of the other; those must be properly adjusted to each other; forwhere the number of the poor exceeds the proportion we have mentioned,there a democracy will rise up, and if the husbandry should havemore power than others, it will be a democracy of husbandmen; and thedemocracy will be a particular species according to that class ofmen which may happen to be most numerous: thus, should these be thehusbandmen, it will be of these, and the best; if of mechanics and thosewho hire themselves out, the worst possible: in the same manner it maybe of any other set between these two. But when the rich and the nobleprevail more by their quality than they are deficient in quantity, therean oligarchy ensues; and this oligarchy may be of different species,according to the nature of the prevailing party. Every legislator inframing his constitution ought to have a particular regard to those inthe middle rank of life; and if he intends an oligarchy, these shouldbe the object of his laws; if a democracy, to these they should beentrusted; and whenever their number exceeds that of the two others, orat least one of them, they give [1297a] stability to the constitution;for there is no fear that the rich and the poor should agree to conspiretogether against them, for neither of these will choose to serve theother. If any one would choose to fix the administration on the widestbasis, he will find none preferable to this; for to rule by turns iswhat the rich and the poor will not submit to, on account of theirhatred to each other. It is, moreover, allowed that an arbitrator is themost proper person for both parties to trust to; now this arbitrator isthe middle rank.Those who would establish aristocratical governments are mistaken notonly in giving too much power to the rich, but also in deceiving thecommon people; for at last, instead of an imaginary good, they must feela real evil, for the encroachments of the rich are more destructive tothe state than those of the poor.CHAPTER XIIIThere are five particulars in which, under fair pretences, the richcraftily endeavour to undermine the rights of the people, these aretheir public assemblies, their offices of state, their courts ofjustice, their military power, and their gymnastic exercises. Withrespect to their public assemblies, in having them open to all, but infining the rich only, or others very little, for not attending; withrespect to offices, in permitting the poor to swear off, but notgranting this indulgence to those who are within the census;with respect to their courts of justice, in fining the rich fornon-attendance, but the poor not at all, or those a great deal, andthese very little, as was done by the laws of Charondas. In someplaces every citizen who was enrolled had a right to attend the publicassemblies and to try causes; which if they did not do, a very heavyfine was laid upon them; that through fear of the fine they might avoidbeing enrolled, as they were then obliged to do neither the one nor theother. The same spirit of legislation prevailed with respect to theirbearing arms and their gymnastic exercises; for the poor are excused ifthey have no arms, but the rich are fined; the same method takes placeif they do not attend their gymnastic exercises, there is no penalty onone, but there is on the other: the consequence of which is, that thefear of this penalty induces the rich to keep the one and attend theother, while the poor do neither. These are the deceitful contrivancesof oligarchical legislators.The contrary prevails in a democracy; for there they make the poor aproper allowance for attending the assemblies and the courts, but givethe rich nothing for doing it: whence it is evident, that if any onewould properly blend these customs together, they must extend both thepay and the fine to every member of the community, and then every onewould share in it, whereas part only now do. The citizens of a freestate ought to [1297b] consist of those only who bear arms: with respectto their census it is not easy to determine exactly what it ought to be,but the rule that should direct upon this subject should be to make itas extensive as possible, so that those who are enrolled in it make upa greater part of the people than those who are not; for those who arepoor, although they partake not of the offices of the state, are willingto live quiet, provided that no one disturbs them in their property: butthis is not an easy matter; for it may not always happen, that those whoare at the head of public affairs are of a humane behaviour. In timeof war the poor are accustomed to show no alacrity without they haveprovisions found them; when they have, then indeed they are willing tofight.In some governments the power is vested not only in those who bear arms,but also in those who have borne them. Among the Malienses the state wascomposed of these latter only, for all the officers were soldiers whohad served their time. And the first states in Greece which succeededthose where kingly power was established, were governed by the military.First of all the horse, for at that time the strength and excellence ofthe army depended on the horse, for as to the heavy-armed foot they wereuseless without proper discipline; but the art of tactics was not knownto the ancients, for which reason their strength lay in their horse: butwhen cities grew larger, and they depended more on their foot, greaternumbers partook of the freedom of the city; for which reason what wecall republics were formerly called democracies. The ancient governmentswere properly oligarchies or kingdoms; for on account of the few personsin each state, it would have been impossible to have found a sufficientnumber of the middle rank; so these being but few, and those used tosubordination, they more easily submitted to be governed.We have now shown why there are many sorts of governments, and othersdifferent from those we have treated of: for there are more species ofdemocracies than one, and the like is true of other forms, and what aretheir differences, and whence they arise; and also of all otherswhich is the best, at least in general; and which is best suited forparticular people.CHAPTER XIVWe will now proceed to make some general reflections upon thegovernments next in order, and also to consider each of them inparticular; beginning with those principles which appertain to each: nowthere are three things in all states which a careful legislator oughtwell to consider, which are of great consequence to all, and whichproperly attended to the state must necessarily be happy; and accordingto the variation of which the one will differ from the other. The firstof these is the [1298a] public assembly; the second the officers of thestate, that is, who they ought to be, and with what power they should beentrusted, and in what manner they should be appointed; the third, thejudicial department.Now it is the proper business of the public assembly to determineconcerning war and peace, making or breaking off alliances, to enactlaws, to sentence to death, banishment, or confiscation of goods, and tocall the magistrates to account for their behaviour when in office. Nowthese powers must necessarily be entrusted to the citizens in general,or all of them to some; either to one magistrate or more; or some toone, and some to another, or some to all, but others to some: to entrustall to all is in the spirit of a democracy, for the people aim atequality. There are many methods of delegating these powers to thecitizens at large, one of which is to let them execute them by turn, andnot altogether, as was done by Tellecles, the Milesian, in his state. Inothers the supreme council is composed of the different magistrates,and they succeed to the offices of the community by proper divisions oftribes, wards, and other very small proportions, till every one in histurn goes through them: nor does the whole community ever meet together,without it is when new laws are enacted, or some national affair isdebated, or to hear what the magistrates have to propose to them.Another method is for the people to meet in a collective body, butonly for the purpose of holding the comitia, making laws, determiningconcerning war or peace, and inquiring into the conduct of theirmagistrates, while the remaining part of the public business isconducted by the magistrates, who have their separate departments, andare chosen out of the whole community either by vote or ballot. Anothermethod is for the people in general to meet for the choice of themagistrates, and to examine into their conduct; and also to deliberateconcerning war and alliances, and to leave other things to themagistrates, whoever happen to be chosen, whose particular employmentsare such as necessarily require persons well skilled therein. A fourthmethod is for every person to deliberate upon every subject in publicassembly, where the magistrates can determine nothing of themselves, andhave only the privilege of giving their opinions first; and this is themethod of the most pure democracy, which is analogous to the proceedingsin a dynastic oligarchy and a tyrannic monarchy.These, then, are the methods in which public business is conducted in ademocracy. When the power is in the hands of part of the communityonly, it is an oligarchy and this also admits of different customs; forwhenever the officers of the state are chosen out of those who have amoderate fortune, and these from that circumstance are many, andwhen they depart not from that line which the law has laid down, butcarefully follow it, and when all within the census are eligible,certainly it is then an oligarchy, but founded on true principles ofgovernment [1298b] from its moderation. When the people in general donot partake of the deliberative power, but certain persons chosen forthat purpose, who govern according to law; this also, like the first,is an oligarchy. When those who have the deliberative power elect eachother, and the son succeeds to the father, and when they can supersedethe laws, such a government is of necessity a strict oligarchy. Whensome persons determine on one thing, and others on another, as war andpeace, and when all inquire into the conduct of their magistrates, andother things are left to different officers, elected either by vote orlot, then the government is an aristocracy or a free state. When someare chosen by vote and others by lot, and these either from the peoplein general, or from a certain number elected for that purpose, or ifboth the votes and the lots are open to all, such a state is partly anaristocracy, partly a free government itself. These are the differentmethods in which the deliberative power is vested in different states,all of whom follow some regulation here laid down. It is advantageous toa democracy, in the present sense of the word, by which I mean a statewherein the people at large have a supreme power, even over the laws, tohold frequent public assemblies; and it will be best in this particularto imitate the example of oligarchies in their courts of justice; forthey fine those who are appointed to try causes if they do not attend,so should they reward the poor for coming to the public assemblies:and their counsels will be best when all advise with each other, thecitizens with the nobles, the nobles with the citizens. It is alsoadvisable when the council is to be composed of part of the citizens, toelect, either by vote or lot, an equal number of both ranks. It is alsoproper, if the common people in the state are very numerous, either notto pay every one for his attendance, but such a number only as will makethem equal to the nobles, or to reject many of them by lot.In an oligarchy they should either call up some of the common people tothe council, or else establish a court, as is done in some other states,whom they call pre-advisers or guardians of the laws, whose businessshould be to propose first what they should afterwards enact. By thismeans the people would have a place in the administration of publicaffairs, without having it in their power to occasion any disorder inthe government. Moreover, the people may be allowed to have a votein whatever bill is proposed, but may not themselves propose anythingcontrary thereto; or they may give their advice, while the power ofdetermining may be with the magistrates only. It is also necessary tofollow a contrary practice to what is established in democracies,for the people should be allowed the power of pardoning, but notof condemning, for the cause should be referred back again to themagistrates: whereas the contrary takes place in republics; for thepower of pardoning is with the few, but not of condemning, which isalways referred [1299a] to the people at large. And thus we determineconcerning the deliberative power in any state, and in whose hands itshall be.CHAPTER XVWe now proceed to consider the choice of magistrates; for this branch ofpublic business contains many different Parts, as how many there shallbe, what shall be their particular office, and with respect to time howlong each of them shall continue in place; for some make it six months,others shorter, others for a year, others for a much longer time; orwhether they should be perpetual or for a long time, or neither; forthe same person may fill the same office several times, or he may not beallowed to enjoy it even twice, but only once: and also with respect tothe appointment of magistrates, who are to be eligible, who is to choosethem, and in what manner; for in all these particulars we ought properlyto distinguish the different ways which may be followed; and then toshow which of these is best suited to such and such governments.Now it is not easy to determine to whom we ought properly to give thename of magistrate, for a government requires many persons in office;but every one of those who is either chosen by vote or lot is not to bereckoned a magistrate. The priests, for instance, in the first place;for these are to be considered as very different from civil magistrates:to these we may add the choregi and heralds; nay, even ambassadors areelected: there are some civil employments which belong to the citizens;and these are either when they are all engaged in one thing, as when assoldiers they obey their general, or when part of them only are, as ingoverning the women or educating the youth; and also some economic, forthey often elect corn-meters: others are servile, and in which, if theyare rich, they employ slaves. But indeed they are most properly calledmagistrates, who are members of the deliberative council, or decidecauses, or are in some command, the last more especially, for to commandis peculiar to magistrates. But to speak truth, this question is ofno great consequence, nor is it the province of the judges to decidebetween those who dispute about words; it may indeed be an object ofspeculative inquiry; but to inquire what officers are necessary in astate, and how many, and what, though not most necessary, may yet beadvantageous in a well-established government, is a much more usefulemployment, and this with respect to all states in general, as well asto small cities.In extensive governments it is proper to allot one employment to oneperson, as there are many to serve the public in so numerous a society,where some may be passed over for a long time, and others never be inoffice but once; and indeed everything is better done which has thewhole attention of one person, than when that [1299b] attention isdivided amongst many; but in small states it is necessary that a few ofthe citizens should execute many employments; for their numbers are sosmall it will not be convenient to have many of them in office at thesame time; for where shall we find others to succeed them in turn? Smallstates will sometimes want the same magistrates and the same laws aslarge ones; but the one will not want to employ them so often as theother; so that different charges may be intrusted to the same personwithout any inconvenience, for they will not interfere with eachother, and for want of sufficient members in the community it will benecessary. If we could tell how many magistrates are necessary in everycity, and how many, though not necessary, it is yet proper to have, wecould then the better know how many different offices one might assignto one magistrate. It is also necessary to know what tribunals indifferent places should have different things under their jurisdiction,and also what things should always come under the cognisance of the samemagistrate; as, for instance, decency of manners, shall the clerk of themarket take cognisance of that if the cause arises in the market, andanother magistrate in another place, or the same magistrate everywhere:or shall there be a distinction made of the fact, or the parties? as,for instance, in decency of manners, shall it be one cause when itrelates to a man, another when it relates to a woman?In different states shall the magistrates be different or the same?I mean, whether in a democracy, an oligarchy, an aristocracy, and amonarchy, the same persons shall have the same power? or shall itvary according to the different formation of the government? as in anaristocracy the offices of the state are allotted to those who are welleducated; in an oligarchy to those who are rich; in a democracy to thefreemen? Or shall the magistrates differ as the communities differ?For it may happen that the very same may be sometimes proper, sometimesotherwise: in this state it may be necessary that the magistrate havegreat powers, in that but small. There are also certain magistratespeculiar to certain states--as the pre-advisers are not proper in ademocracy, but a senate is; for one such order is necessary, whosebusiness shall be to consider beforehand and prepare those bills whichshall be brought before the people that they may have leisure toattend to their own affairs; and when these are few in number the stateinclines to an oligarchy. The pre-advisers indeed must always be fewfor they are peculiar to an oligarchy: and where there are boththese offices in the same state, the pre-adviser's is superior tothe senator's, the one having only a democratical power, the other anoligarchical: and indeed the [1300a] power of the senate is lost inthose democracies, in which the people, meeting in one public assembly,take all the business into their own hands; and this is likely to happeneither when the community in general are in easy circumstances, or whenthey are paid for their attendance; for they are then at leisure oftento meet together and determine everything for themselves. A magistratewhose business is to control the manners of the boys, or women, or whotakes any department similar to this, is to be found in an aristocracy,not in a democracy; for who can forbid the wives of the poor fromappearing in public? neither is such a one to be met with in anoligarchy; for the women there are too delicate to bear control. Andthus much for this subject. Let us endeavour to treat at large of theestablishment of magistrates, beginning from first principles. Now, theydiffer from each other in three ways, from which, blended together,all the varieties which can be imagined arise. The first of thesedifferences is in those who appoint the magistrates, the second consistsin those who are appointed, the third in the mode of appointment; andeach of these three differ in three manners; for either all the citizensmay appoint collectively, or some out of their whole body, or some outof a particular order in it, according to fortune, family, or virtue, orsome other rule (as at Megara, where the right of election was amongstthose who had returned together to their country, and had reinstatedthemselves by force of arms) and this either by vote or lot. Again,these several modes may be differently formed together, as somemagistrates may be chosen by part of the community, others by the whole;some out of part, others out of the whole; some by vote, others by lot:and each of these different modes admit of a four-fold subdivision; foreither all may elect all by vote or by lot; and when all elect, they mayeither proceed without any distinction, or they may elect by a certaindivision of tribes, wards, or companies, till they have gone through thewhole community: and some magistrates may be elected one way, and othersanother. Again, if some magistrates are elected either by vote or lotof all the citizens, or by the vote of some and the lot of some, orsome one way and some another; that is to say, some by the vote of all,others by the lot of all, there will then be twelve different methodsof electing the magistrates, without blending the two together. Ofthese there are two adapted to a democracy; namely, to have all themagistrates chosen out of all the people, either by vote or lot, orboth; that is to say, some of them by lot, some by vote. In a free statethe whole community should not elect at the same time, but some out ofthe whole, or out of some particular rank; and this either by lot, orvote, or both: and they should elect either out of the whole community,or out of some particular persons in it, and this both by lot and vote.In an oligarchy it is proper to choose some magistrates out of the wholebody of the citizens, some by vote, some by lot, others by both: by lotis most correspondent to that form of government. In a free aristocracy,some magistrates [1300b] should be chosen out of the community ingeneral, others out of a particular rank, or these by choice, thoseby lot. In a pure oligarchy, the magistrates should be chosen out ofcertain ranks, and by certain persons, and some of those by lot, othersby both methods; but to choose them out of the whole community is notcorrespondent to the nature of this government. It is proper in anaristocracy for the whole community to elect their magistrates out ofparticular persons, and this by vote. These then are all the differentways of electing of magistrates; and they have been allotted accordingto the nature of the different communities; but what mode of proceedingis proper for different communities, or how the offices ought to beestablished, or with what powers shall be particularly explained. I meanby the powers of a magistrate, what should be his particular province,as the management of the finances or the laws of the state; fordifferent magistrates have different powers, as that of the general ofthe army differs from the clerk of the market.CHAPTER XVIOf the three parts of which a government is formed, we now come toconsider the judicial; and this also we shall divide in the same manneras we did the magisterial, into three parts. Of whom the judges shallconsist, and for what causes, and how. When I say of whom, I meanwhether they shall be the whole people, or some particulars; by for whatcauses I mean, how many different courts shall be appointed; by how,whether they shall be elected by vote or lot. Let us first determine howmany different courts there ought to be. Now these are eight. Thefirst of these is the court of inspection over the behaviour of themagistrates when they have quitted their office; the second is to punishthose who have injured the public; the third is to take cognisance ofthose causes in which the state is a party; the fourth is to decidebetween magistrates and private persons, who appeal from a fine laidupon them; the fifth is to determine disputes which may arise concerningcontracts of great value; the sixth is to judge between foreigners, andof murders, of which there are different species; and these may all betried by the same judges or by different ones; for there are murdersof malice prepense and of chance-medley; there is also justifiablehomicide, where the fact is admitted, and the legality of it disputed.There is also another court called at Athens the Court of Phreattae,which determines points relating to a murder committed by one who hasrun away, to decide whether he shall return; though such an affairhappens but seldom, and in very large cities; the seventh, to determinecauses wherein strangers are concerned, and this whether they arebetween stranger and stranger or between a stranger and a citizen. Theeighth and last is for small actions, from one to five drachma's, or alittle more; for these ought also to be legally determined, but not tobe brought before the whole body of the judges. But without enteringinto any particulars concerning actions for murder, and those whereinstrangers are the parties, let us particularly treat of those courtswhich have the jurisdiction of those matters which more particularlyrelate to the affairs of the community and which if not well conductedoccasion seditions and commotions in the state. Now, of necessity,either all persons must have a right to judge of all these differentcauses, appointed for that purpose, either by vote or lot, or all ofall, some of them by vote, and others by lot, or in some causes by vote,in others by lot. Thus there will be four sorts of judges. There [1301a]will be just the same number also if they are chosen out of part of thepeople only; for either all the judges must be chosen out of that parteither by vote or lot, or some by lot and some by vote, or the judges inparticular causes must be chosen some by vote, others by lot; by whichmeans there will be the same number of them also as was mentioned.Besides, different judges may be joined together; I mean those who arechosen out of the whole people or part of them or both; so that allthree may sit together in the same court, and this either by vote,lot, or both. And thus much for the different sorts of judges. Of theseappointments that which admits all the community to be judges in allcauses is most suitable to a democracy; the second, which appoints thatcertain persons shall judge all causes, to an oligarchy; the third,which appoints the whole community to be judges in some causes, butparticular persons in others, to an aristocracy or free state.BOOK VWe have now gone through those particulars we proposed to speak of; itremains that we next consider from what causes and how alterationsin government arise, and of what nature they are, and to what thedestruction of each state is owing; and also to what form any form ofpolity is most likely to shift into, and what are the means to beused for the general preservation of governments, as well as what areapplicable to any particular state; and also of the remedies whichare to be applied either to all in general, or to any one consideredseparately, when they are in a state of corruption: and here we oughtfirst to lay down this principle, that there are many governments, allof which approve of what is just and what is analogically equal; and yethave failed from attaining thereunto, as we have already mentioned; thusdemocracies have arisen from supposing that those who are equal in onething are so in every other circumstance; as, because they are equalin liberty, they are equal in everything else; and oligarchies, fromsupposing that those who are unequal in one thing are unequal in all;that when men are so in point of fortune, that inequality extends toeverything else. Hence it follows, that those who in some respects areequal with others think it right to endeavour to partake of an equalitywith them in everything; and those who are superior to others endeavourto get still more; and it is this more which is the inequality: thusmost states, though they have some notion of what is just, yet arealmost totally wrong; and, upon this account, when either party has notthat share in the administration which answers to his expectations, hebecomes seditious: but those who of all others have the greatest rightto be so are the last that are; namely, those who excel in virtue;for they alone can be called generally superior. There are, too, somepersons of distinguished families who, because they are so, disdain tobe on an equality with others, for those esteem themselves noble whoboast of their ancestors' merit and fortune: these, to speak truth, arethe origin and fountain from whence seditions arise. The alterationswhich men may propose to make in governments are two; for either theymay change the state already established into some other, as whenthey propose to erect an oligarchy where there is a democracy; or ademocracy, or free state, where there is an oligarchy, or an aristocracyfrom these, or those from that; or else, when they have no objectionto the established government, which they like very well, but choose tohave the sole management in it themselves; either in the hands of a fewor one only. They will also raise commotions concerning the degree inwhich they would have the established power; as if, for instance, thegovernment is an oligarchy, to have it more purely so, and in the samemanner if it is a democracy, or else to have it less so; and, in likemanner, whatever may be the nature of the government, either to extendor contract its powers; or else to make some alterations in some partsof it; as to establish or abolish a particular magistracy, as somepersons say Lysander endeavoured to abolish the kingly power in Sparta;and Pausanias that of the ephori. Thus in Epidamnus there was analteration in one part of the constitution, for instead of the philarchithey established a senate. It is also necessary for all the magistratesat Athens; to attend in the court of the Helisea when any new magistrateis created: the power of the archon also in that state partakes of thenature of an oligarchy: inequality is always the occasion of sedition,but not when those who are unequal are treated in a different mannercorrespondent to that inequality. Thus kingly power is unequal whenexercised over equals. Upon the whole, those who aim after an equalityare the cause of seditions. Equality is twofold, either in number orvalue. Equality in number is when two things contain the same parts orthe same quantity; equality in value is by proportion as two exceedsone, and three two by the same number-thus by proportion four exceedstwo, and two one in the same degree, for two is the same part of fourthat one is of two; that is to say, half. Now, all agree in what isabsolutely and simply just; but, as we have already said they disputeconcerning proportionate value; for some persons, if they are equal inone respect, think themselves equal in all; others, if they are superiorin one thing, think they may claim the superiority in all; from whencechiefly arise two sorts of governments, a democracy and an oligarchy;for nobility and virtue are to be found only [1302a] amongst a few;the contrary amongst the many; there being in no place a hundred ofthe first to be met with, but enough of the last everywhere. But toestablish a government entirely upon either of these equalities iswrong, and this the example of those so established makes evident,for none of them have been stable; and for this reason, that it isimpossible that whatever is wrong at the first and in its principlesshould not at last meet with a bad end: for which reason in some thingsan equality of numbers ought to take place, in others an equality invalue. However, a democracy is safer and less liable to sedition than anoligarchy; for in this latter it may arise from two causes, for eitherthe few in power may conspire against each other or against thepeople; but in a democracy only one; namely, against the few who aimat exclusive power; but there is no instance worth speaking of, ofa sedition of the people against themselves. Moreover, a governmentcomposed of men of moderate fortunes comes much nearer to a democracythan an oligarchy, and is the safest of all such states.ISince we are inquiring into the causes of seditions and revolutionsin governments, we must begin entirely with the first principles fromwhence they arise. Now these, so to speak, are nearly three in number;which we must first distinguish in general from each other, andendeavour to show in what situation people are who begin a sedition;and for what causes; and thirdly, what are the beginnings of politicaltroubles and mutual quarrels with each other. Now that cause which ofall others most universally inclines men to desire to bring about achange in government is that which I have already mentioned; for thosewho aim at equality will be ever ready for sedition, if they see thosewhom they esteem their equals possess more than they do, as well asthose also who are not content with equality but aim at superiority, ifthey think that while they deserve more than, they have only equal with,or less than, their inferiors. Now, what they aim at may be either justor unjust; just, when those who are inferior are seditious, that theymay be equal; unjust, when those who are equal are so, that they maybe superior. These, then, are the situations in which men will beseditious: the causes for which they will be so are profit and honour;and their contrary: for, to avoid dishonour or loss of fortune bymulcts, either on their own account or their friends, they will raisea commotion in the state. The original causes which dispose men to thethings which I have mentioned are, taken in one manner, seven in number,in another they are more; two of which are the same with those thathave been already mentioned: but influencing in a different manner;for profit and honour sharpen men against each other; not to get thepossession of them for themselves (which was what I just now supposed),but when they see others, some justly, others [1302b] unjustly,engrossing them. The other causes are haughtiness, fear, eminence,contempt, disproportionate increase in some part of the state. There arealso other things which in a different manner will occasion revolutionsin governments; as election intrigues, neglect, want of numbers, a toogreat dissimilarity of circumstances.IIWhat influence ill-treatment and profit have for this purpose, and howthey may be the causes of sedition, is almost self-evident; for when themagistrates are haughty and endeavour to make greater profits than theiroffice gives them, they not only occasion seditions amongst each other,but against the state also who gave them their power; and this theiravarice has two objects, either private property or the property of thestate. What influence honours have, and how they may occasion sedition,is evident enough; for those who are themselves unhonoured while theysee others honoured, will be ready for any disturbance: and these thingsare done unjustly when any one is either honoured or discarded contraryto their deserts, justly when they are according to them. Excessivehonours are also a cause of sedition when one person or more are greaterthan the state and the power of the government can permit; for thena monarchy or a dynasty is usually established: on which account theostracism was introduced in some places, as at Argos and Athens: thoughit is better to guard against such excesses in the founding of a state,than when they have been permitted to take place, to correct themafterward. Those who have been guilty of crimes will be the cause ofsedition, through fear of punishment; as will those also who expect aninjury, that they may prevent it; as was the case at Rhodes, when thenobles conspired against the people on account of the decrees theyexpected would pass against them. Contempt also is a cause of seditionand conspiracies; as in oligarchies, where there are many who haveno share in the administration. The rich also even in democracies,despising the disorder and anarchy which will arise, hope to betterthemselves by the same means which happened at Thebes after the battleof Oenophyta, where, in consequence of bad administration, the democracywas destroyed; as it was at Megara, where the power of the people waslost through anarchy and disorder; the same thing happened at Syracusebefore the tyranny of Gelon; and at Rhodes there was the same seditionbefore the popular government was overthrown. Revolutions in state willalso arise from a disproportionate increase; for as the body consistsof many parts, it ought to increase proportion-ably to preserve itssymmetry, which would otherwise be destroyed; as if the foot was tobe four cubits long, and the rest of the body but two palms; it mightotherwise [1303a] be changed into an animal of a different form, if itincrease beyond proportion not only in quantity, but also in dispositionof parts; so also a city consists of parts, some of which may oftenincrease without notice, as the number of poor in democracies and freestates. They will also sometimes happen by accident, as at Tarentum, alittle after the Median war, where so many of the nobles were killed ina battle by the lapygi, that from a free state the government was turnedinto a democracy; and at Argos, where so many of the citizens werekilled by Cleomenes the Spartan, that they were obliged to admit severalhusbandmen to the freedom of the state: and at Athens, through theunfortunate event of the infantry battles, the number of the nobles wasreduced by the soldiers being chosen from the list of citizens inthe Lacedaemonian wars. Revolutions also sometimes take place ina democracy, though seldomer; for where the rich grow numerous orproperties increase, they become oligarchies or dynasties. Governmentsalso sometimes alter without seditions by a combination of the meanerpeople; as at Hersea: for which purpose they changed the mode ofelection from votes to lots, and thus got themselves chosen: and bynegligence, as when the citizens admit those who are not friends tothe constitution into the chief offices of the state, which happenedat Orus, when the oligarchy of the archons was put an end to at theelection of Heracleodorus, who changed that form of government into ademocratic free state. By little and little, I mean by this, that veryoften great alterations silently take place in the form of governmentfrom people's overlooking small matters; as at Ambracia, where thecensus was originally small, but at last became nothing at all, as if alittle and nothing at all were nearly or entirely alike. That statealso is liable to seditions which is composed of different nations, tilltheir differences are blended together and undistinguishable; for as acity cannot be composed of every multitude, so neither can it in everygiven time; for which reason all those republics which have hithertobeen originally composed of different people or afterwards admittedtheir neighbours to the freedom of their city, have been most liableto revolutions; as when the Achaeans joined with the Traezeniansin founding Sybaris; for soon after, growing more powerful than theTraezenians, they expelled them from the city; from whence came theproverb of Sybarite wickedness: and again, disputes from a like causehappened at Thurium between the Sybarites and those who had joined withthem in building the city; for they assuming upon these, on account ofthe country being their own, were driven out. And at Byzantium the newcitizens, being detected in plots against the state, were driven out ofthe city by force of arms. The Antisseans also, having taken in thosewho were banished from Chios, afterwards did the same thing; andalso the Zancleans, after having taken in the people of Samos. TheAppolloniats, in the Euxine Sea, having admitted their sojourners tothe freedom of their city, were troubled with seditions: and theSyracusians, after the expulsion of their tyrants, having enrolled[1303b] strangers and mercenaries amongst their citizens, quarrelledwith each other and came to an open rupture: and the people ofAmphipolis, having taken in a colony of Chalcidians, were the greaterpart of them driven out of the city by them. Many persons occasionseditions in oligarchies because they think themselves ill-used in notsharing the honours of the state with their equals, as I have alreadymentioned; but in democracies the principal people do the same becausethey have not more than an equal share with others who are not equalto them. The situation of the place will also sometimes occasiondisturbances in the state when the ground is not well adapted for onecity; as at Clazomene, where the people who lived in that part of thetown called Chytrum quarrelled with them who lived in the island, andthe Colophonians with the Notians. At Athens too the disposition of thecitizens is not the same, for those who live in the Piraeus are moreattached to a popular government than those who live in the cityproperly so called; for as the interposition of a rivulet, howeversmall, will occasion the line of the phalanx to fluctuate, so anytrifling disagreement will be the cause of seditions; but they will notso soon flow from anything else as from the disagreement between virtueand vice, and next to that between poverty and riches, and so on inorder, one cause having more influence than another; one of which that Ilast mentioned.VBut seditions in government do not arise for little things, but fromthem; for their immediate cause is something of moment. Now, triflingquarrels are attended with the greatest consequences when they arisebetween persons of the first distinction in the state, as was thecase with the Syracusians in a remote period; for a revolution in thegovernment was brought about by a quarrel between two young men who werein office, upon a love affair; for one of them being absent, the otherseduced his mistress; he in his turn, offended with this, persuaded hisfriend's wife to come and live with him; and upon this the whole citytook part either with the one or the other, and the government wasoverturned: therefore every one at the beginning of such disputes oughtto take care to avoid the consequences; and to smother up all quarrelswhich may happen to arise amongst those in power, for the mischief liesin the beginning; for the beginning is said to be half of the business,so that what was then but a little fault will be found afterwards tobear its full proportion to what follows. Moreover, disputes between menof note involve the whole city in their consequences; in Hestiaea,after the Median war: two brothers having a dispute about their paternalestate; he who was the poorer, from the other's having concealed partof the effects, and some money which his father had found, engaged thepopular party on his side, while the other, who was rich, the men offashion. And at Delphos, [1304a] a quarrel about a wedding was thebeginning of all the seditions that afterwards arose amongst them; forthe bridegroom, being terrified by some unlucky omen upon waitingupon the bride, went away without marrying her; which her relationsresenting, contrived secretly to convey some sacred money into hispocket while he was sacrificing, and then killed him as an impiousperson. At Mitylene also, a dispute, which arose concerning a rightof heritage, was the beginning of great evils, and a war with theAthenians, in which Paches took their city, for Timophanes, a manof fortune, leaving two daughters, Doxander, who was circumvented inprocuring them in marriage for his two sons, began a sedition, andexcited the Athenians to attack them, being the host of that state.There was also a dispute at Phocea, concerning a right of inheritance,between Mnasis, the father of Mnasis, and Euthucrates, the father ofOnomarchus, which brought on the Phoceans the sacred war. The governmenttoo of Epidamnus was changed from a quarrel that arose from an intendedmarriage; for a certain man having contracted his daughter in marriage,the father of the young person to whom she was contracted, being archon,punishes him, upon which account he, resenting the affront, associatedhimself with those who were excluded from any share in the government,and brought about a revolution. A government may be changed either intoan oligarchy, democracy, or a free state; when the magistrates, or anypart of the city acquire great credit, or are increased in power, as thecourt of Areopagus at Athens, having procured great credit during theMedian war, added firmness to their administration; and, on the otherhand, the maritime force, composed of the commonalty, having gained thevictory at Salamis, by their power at sea, got the lead in the state,and strengthened the popular party: and at Argos, the nobles,having gained great credit by the battle of Mantinea against theLacedaemonians, endeavoured to dissolve the democracy. And at Syracuse,the victory in their war with the Athenians being owing to the commonpeople, they changed their free state into a democracy: and at Chalcis,the people having taken off the tyrant Phocis, together with the nobles,immediately seized the government: and at Ambracia also the people,having expelled the tyrant Periander, with his party, placed thesupreme power in themselves. And this in general ought to be known,that whosoever has been the occasion of a state being powerful, whetherprivate persons, or magistrates, a certain tribe, or any particular partof the citizens, or the multitude, be they who they will, will be thecause of disputes in the state. For either some persons, who envy themthe honours they have acquired, will begin to be seditious, or they,on account of the dignity they have acquired, will not be content withtheir former equality. A state is also liable to commotions when thoseparts of it which seem to be opposite to each other approach to an[1304b] equality, as the rich and the common people; so that the partwhich is between them both is either nothing at all, or too little to benoticed; for if one party is so much more powerful than the other, asto be evidently stronger, that other will not be willing to hazard thedanger: for which reason those who are superior in excellence and virtuewill never be the cause of seditions; for they will be too few for thatpurpose when compared to the many. In general, the beginning and thecauses of seditions in all states are such as I have now described, andrevolutions therein are brought about in two ways, either by violence orfraud: if by violence, either at first by compelling them to submit tothe change when it is made. It may also be brought about by fraud intwo different ways, either when the people, being at first deceived,willingly consent to an alteration in their government, and areafterwards obliged by force to abide by it: as, for instance, when thefour hundred imposed upon the people by telling them that the kingof Persia would supply them with money for the war against theLacedaemonians; and after they had been guilty of this falsity, theyendeavoured to keep possession of the supreme power; or when they areat first persuaded and afterwards consent to be governed: and by one ofthese methods which I have mentioned are all revolutions in governmentsbrought about.CHAPTER VWe ought now to inquire into those events which will arise from thesecauses in every species of government. Democracies will be most subjectto revolutions from the dishonesty of their demagogues; for partly, byinforming against men of property, they induce them to join togetherthrough self-defence, for a common fear will make the greatest enemiesunite; and partly by setting the common people against them: and this iswhat any one may continually see practised in many states. In the islandof Cos, for instance, the democracy was subverted by the wickednessof the demagogues, for the nobles entered into a combination witheach other. And at Rhodes the demagogues, by distributing of bribes,prevented the people from paying the trierarchs what was owing to them,who were obliged by the number of actions they were harassed with toconspire together and destroy the popular state. The same thing wasbrought about at Heraclea, soon after the settlement of the city, bythe same persons; for the citizens of note, being ill treated by them,quitted the city, but afterwards joining together they returned andoverthrew the popular state. Just in the same manner the democracywas destroyed in Megara; for there the demagogues, to procure money byconfiscations, drove out the nobles, till the number of those who werebanished was considerable, who, [1305a] returning, got the better of thepeople in a battle, and established an oligarchy. The like happened atCume, during the time of the democracy, which Thrasymachus destroyed;and whoever considers what has happened in other states may perceive thesame revolutions to have arisen from the same causes. The demagogues,to curry favour with the people, drive the nobles to conspire together,either by dividing their estates, or obliging them to spend them onpublic services, or by banishing them, that they may confiscate thefortunes of the wealthy. In former times, when the same person was bothdemagogue and general, the democracies were changed into tyrannies; andindeed most of the ancient tyrannies arose from those states: a reasonfor which then subsisted, but not now; for at that time the demagogueswere of the soldiery; for they were not then powerful by theireloquence; but, now the art of oratory is cultivated, the able speakersare at present the demagogues; but, as they are unqualified to act ina military capacity, they cannot impose themselves on the people astyrants, if we except in one or two trifling instances. Formerly, too,tyrannies were more common than now, on account of the very extensivepowers with which some magistrates were entrusted: as the prytanes atMiletus; for they were supreme in many things of the last consequence;and also because at that time the cities were not of that very greatextent, the people in general living in the country, and being employedin husbandry, which gave them, who took the lead in public affairs, anopportunity, if they had a turn for war, to make themselves tyrants;which they all did when they had gained the confidence of the people;and this confidence was their hatred to the rich. This was the case ofPisistratus at Athens, when he opposed the Pediaci: and of Theagenes inMegara, who slaughtered the cattle belonging to the rich, after hehad seized those who kept them by the riverside. Dionysius also, foraccusing Daphnseus and the rich, was thought worthy of being raised to atyranny, from the confidence which the people had of his being a popularman in consequence of these enmities. A government shall also alter fromits ancient and approved democratic form into one entirely new, ifthere is no census to regulate the election of magistrates; for, as theelection is with the people, the demagogues who are desirous of being inoffice, to flatter them, will endeavour with all their power to make thepeople superior even to the laws. To prevent this entirely, or at leastin a great measure, the magistrates should be elected by the tribes, andnot by the people at large. These are nearly the revolutions to whichdemocracies are liable, and also the causes from whence they arise.CHAPTER VIThere are two things which of all others most evidently occasion arevolution in an oligarchy; one is, when the people are ill used, forthen every individual is ripe for [1305b] sedition; more particularly ifone of the oligarchy should happen to be their leader; as Lygdamis, atNaxus, who was afterwards tyrant of that island. Seditions also whicharise from different causes will differ from each other; for sometimesa revolution is brought about by the rich who have no share in theadministration, which is in the hands of a very few indeed: and thishappened at Massilia, Ister, Heraclea, and other cities; for those whohad no share in the government ceased not to raise disputes till theywere admitted to it: first the elder brothers, and then the youngeralso: for in some places the father and son are never in office at thesame time; in others the elder and younger brother: and where this isobserved the oligarchy partakes something of a free state. At Ister itwas changed into a democracy; in Heraclea, instead of being in thehands of a few, it consisted of six hundred. At Cnidus the oligarchywas destroyed by the nobles quarrelling with each other, because thegovernment was in the hands of so few: for there, as we have justmentioned, if the father was in office, the son could not; or, if therewere many brothers, the eldest only; for the people, taking advantage oftheir disputes, elected one of the nobles for their general, and got thevictory: for where there are seditions government is weak. And formerlyat Erithria, during the oligarchy of the Basilides, although the stateflourished greatly under their excellent management, yet because thepeople were displeased that the power should be in the hands of sofew, they changed the government. Oligarchies also are subject torevolutions, from those who are in office therein, from the quarrels ofthe demagogues with each other. The demagogues are of two sorts; onewho flatter the few when they are in power: for even these have theirdemagogues; such was Charicles at Athens, who had great influence overthe thirty; and, in the same manner, Phrynichus over the four hundred.The others are those demagogues who have a share in the oligarchy,and flatter the people: such were the state-guardians at Larissa, whoflattered the people because they were elected by them. And this willalways happen in every oligarchy where the magistrates do not electthemselves, but are chosen out of men either of great fortune or certainranks, by the soldiers or by the people; as was the custom at Abydos.And when the judicial department is not in the hands of the supremepower, the demagogues, favouring the people in their causes, overturnthe government; which happened at Heraclea in Pontus: and also whensome desire to contract the power of the oligarchy into fewer hands; forthose who endeavour to support an equality are obliged to apply to thepeople for assistance. An oligarchy is also subject to revolutionswhen the nobility spend their fortunes by luxury; for such persons aredesirous of innovations, and either endeavour to be tyrants themselvesor to support others in being so, as [1306a] Hypparinus supportedDionysius of Syracuse. And at Amphipolis one Cleotimus collected acolony of Chalcidians, and when they came set them to quarrel withthe rich: and at AEgina a certain person who brought an action againstChares attempted on that account to alter the government. Sometimes theywill try to raise commotions, sometimes they will rob the public, andthen quarrel with each other, or else fight with those who endeavourto detect them; which was the case at Apollonia in Pontus. But if themembers of an oligarchy agree among themselves the state is not veryeasily destroyed without some external force. Pharsalus is a proof ofthis, where, though the place is small, yet the citizens have greatpower, from the prudent use they make of it. An oligarchy also will bedestroyed when they create another oligarchy under it; that is, when themanagement of public affairs is in the hands of a few, and not equally,but when all of them do not partake of the supreme power, as happenedonce at Elis, where the supreme power in general was in the hands of avery few out of whom a senate was chosen, consisting but of ninety, whoheld their places for life; and their mode of election was calculated topreserve the power amongst each other's families, like the senators atLacedaemon. An oligarchy is liable to a revolution both in time ofwar and peace; in war, because through a distrust in the citizens thegovernment is obliged to employ mercenary troops, and he to whom theygive the command of the army will very often assume the tyranny, asTimophanes did at Corinth; and if they appoint more than one general,they will very probably establish a dynasty: and sometimes, through fearof this, they are forced to let the people in general have some share inthe government, because they are obliged to employ them. In peace,from their want of confidence in each other, they will entrust theguardianship of the state to mercenaries and their general, who willbe an arbiter between them, and sometimes become master of both, whichhappened at Larissa, when Simos and the Aleuadae had the chief power.The same thing happened at Abydos, during the time of the politicalclubs, of which Iphiades' was one. Commotions also will happen in anoligarchy from one party's overbearing and insulting another, orfrom their quarrelling about their law-suits or marriages. How theirmarriages, for instance, will have that effect has been already shown:and in Eretria, Diagoras destroyed the oligarchy of the knights upon thesame account. A sedition also arose at Heraclea, from a certain personbeing condemned by the court; and at Thebes, in consequence of a man'sbeing guilty of adultery; [1306b] the punishment indeed which Eurytionsuffered at Heraclea was just, yet it was illegally executed: as wasthat at Thebes upon Archias; for their enemies endeavoured to have thempublicly bound in the pillory. Many revolutions also have been broughtabout in oligarchies by those who could not brook the despotism whichthose persons assumed who were in power, as at Cnidus and Chios. Changesalso may happen by accident in what we call a free state and in anoligarchy; wheresoever the senators, judges, and magistrates are chosenaccording to a certain census; for it often happens that the highestcensus is fixed at first; so that a few only could have a share inthe government, in an oligarchy, or in a free state those of moderatefortunes only; when the city grows rich, through peace or some otherhappy cause, it becomes so little that every one's fortune is equal tothe census, so that the whole community may partake of all the honoursof government; and this change sometimes happens by little and little,and insensible approaches, sometimes quicker. These are the revolutionsand seditions that arise in oligarchies, and the causes to which theyare owing: and indeed both democracies and oligarchies sometimes alter,not into governments of a contrary form, but into those of the samegovernment; as, for instance, from having the supreme power in the lawto vest it in the ruling party, or the contrariwise.CHAPTER VIICommotions also arise in aristocracies, from there being so few personsin power (as we have already observed they do in oligarchies, for inthis particular an aristocracy is most near an oligarchy, for in boththese states the administration of public affairs is in the hands ofa few; not that this arises from the same cause in both, though hereinthey chiefly seem alike): and these will necessarily be most likely tohappen when the generality of the people are high-spirited and thinkthemselves equal to each other in merit; such were those at Lacedasmon,called the Partheniae (for these were, as well as others, descendantsof citizens), who being detected in a conspiracy against the state, weresent to found Tarentum. They will happen also when some great men aredisgraced by those who have received higher honours than themselves, towhom they are no ways inferior in abilities, as Lysander by the kings:or when an ambitious man cannot get into power, as Cinadon, who, in thereign of Agesilaus, was chief in a conspiracy against the Spartans:and also when some are too poor and others too rich, which will mostfrequently happen in time of war; as at Lacedaemon during the Messenianwar, which is proved by a poem of Tyrtaeus, [1307a] called \"Eunomia;\"for some persons being reduced thereby, desired that the lands mightbe divided: and also when some person of very high rank might still behigher if he could rule alone, which seemed to be Pausanias's intentionat Lacedaemon, when he was their general in the Median war, and Anno'sat Carthage. But free states and aristocracies are mostly destroyed fromwant of a fixed administration of public affairs; the cause of whichevil arises at first from want of a due mixture of the democratic andthe oligarchic parts in a free state; and in an aristocracy from thesame causes, and also from virtue not being properly joined to power;but chiefly from the two first, I mean the undue mixture of thedemocratic and oligarchic parts; for these two are what all freestates endeavour to blend together, and many of those which we callaristocracies, in this particular these states differ from each other,and on this account the one of them is less stable than the other, forthat state which inclines most to an oligarchy is called an aristocracy,and that which inclines most to a democracy is called a free state; onwhich account this latter is more secure than the former, for the widerthe foundation the securer the building, and it is ever best to livewhere equality prevails. But the rich, if the community gives them rank,very often endeavour to insult and tyrannise over others. On the whole,whichever way a government inclines, in that it will settle, each partysupporting their own. Thus a free state will become a democracy; anaristocracy an oligarchy; or the contrary, an aristocracy may changeinto a democracy (for the poor, if they think themselves injured,directly take part with the contrary side) and a free state into anoligarchy. The only firm state is that where every one enjoys thatequality he has a right to and fully possesses what is his own. And whatI have been speaking of happened to the Thurians; for the magistratesbeing elected according to a very high census, it was altered to alower, and they were subdivided into more courts, but in consequence ofthe nobles possessing all the land, contrary to law; the state was toomuch of an oligarchy, which gave them an opportunity of encroachinggreatly on the rest of the people; but these, after they had been wellinured to war, so far got the better of their guards as to expel everyone out of the country who possessed more than he ought. Moreover, asall aristocracies are free oligarchies, the nobles therein endeavour tohave rather too much power, as at Lacedaemon, where property is now inthe hands of a few, and the nobles have too much liberty to do as theyplease and make such alliances as they please. Thus the city of theLocrians was ruined from an alliance with Dionysius; which state wasneither a democracy nor well-tempered aristocracy. But an aristocracychiefly approaches to a secret change by its being destroyed by degrees,as we [1307b] have already said of all governments in general; and thishappens from the cause of the alteration being trifling; for wheneveranything which in the least regards the state is treated with contempt,after that something else, and this of a little more consequence, willbe more easily altered, until the whole fabric of government is entirelysubverted, which happened in the government of Thurium; for the lawbeing that they should continue soldiers for five years, some youngmen of a martial disposition, who were in great esteem amongst theirofficers, despising those who had the management of public affairs,and imagining they could easily accomplish their intention, firstendeavoured to abolish this law, with a view of having it lawful tocontinue the same person perpetually in the military, perceiving thatthe people would readily appoint them. Upon this, the magistrates whoare called counselors first joined together with an intention to opposeit but were afterwards induced to agree to it, from a belief that ifthat law was not repealed they would permit the management of all otherpublic affairs to remain in their hands; but afterwards, when theyendeavoured to restrain some fresh alterations that were making, theyfound that they could do nothing, for the whole form of government wasaltered into a dynasty of those who first introduced the innovations. Inshort, all governments are liable to be destroyed either from within orfrom without; from without when they have for their neighbour a statewhose policy is contrary to theirs, and indeed if it has great power thesame thing will happen if it is not their neighbour; of which boththe Athenians and the Lacedaemonians are a proof; for the one,when conquerors everywhere destroyed the oligarchies; the other thedemocracies. These are the chief causes of revolutions and dissensionsin governments.CHAPTER VIIIWe are now to consider upon what the preservation of governments ingeneral and of each state in particular depends; and, in the firstplace, it is evident that if we are right in the causes we have assignedfor their destruction, we know also the means of their preservation; forthings contrary produce contraries: but destruction and preservation arecontrary to each other. In well-tempered governments it requires as muchcare as anything whatsoever, that nothing be done contrary to law: andthis ought chiefly to be attended to in matters of small consequence;for an illegality that approaches insensibly, approaches secretly, as ina family small expenses continually repeated consume a man's income;for the understanding is deceived thereby, as by this false argument; ifevery part is little, then the whole is little: now, this in one senseis true, in another is false, for the whole and all the parts togetherare large, though made up of small parts. The first therefore ofanything is what the state ought to guard against. In the next place,no credit ought to be given to those who endeavour to deceive the peoplewith false pretences; for they will be [1308a] confuted by facts. Thedifferent ways in which they will attempt to do this have been alreadymentioned. You may often perceive both aristocracies and oligarchiescontinuing firm, not from the stability of their forms of government,but from the wise conduct of the magistrates, both towards those whohave a part in the management of public affairs, and those also whohave not: towards those who have not, by never injuring them; and alsointroducing those who are of most consequence amongst them into office;nor disgracing those who are desirous of honour; or encroaching on theproperty of individuals; towards those who have, by behaving to eachother upon an equality; for that equality which the favourers of ademocracy desire to have established in the state is not only just,but convenient also, amongst those who are of the same rank: for whichreason, if the administration is in the hands of many, those rules whichare established in democracies will be very useful; as to let no onecontinue in office longer than six months: that all those who are ofthe same rank may have their turn; for between these there is a sortof democracy: for which reason demagogues are most likely to arise upamongst them, as we have already mentioned: besides, by this means botharistocracies and democracies will be the less liable to be corruptedinto dynasties, because it will not be so easy for those who aremagistrates for a little to do as much mischief as they could in along time: for it is from hence that tyrannies arise in democraciesand oligarchies; for either those who are most powerful in each stateestablish a tyranny, as the demagogues in the one, the dynasties in theother, or the chief magistrates who have been long in power. Governmentsare sometimes preserved not only by having the means of their corruptionat a great distance, but also by its being very near them; for those whoare alarmed at some impending evil keep a stricter hand over the state;for which reason it is necessary for those who have the guardianship ofthe constitution to be able to awaken the fears of the people, that theymay preserve it, and not like a night-guard to be remiss in protectingthe state, but to make the distant danger appear at hand. Great careought also to be used to endeavour to restrain the quarrels and disputesof the nobles by laws, as well as to prevent those who are not alreadyengaged in them from taking a part therein; for to perceive an evilat its very first approach is not the lot of every one, but of thepolitician. To prevent any alteration taking place in an oligarchy orfree state on account of the census, if that happens to continue thesame while the quantity of money is increased, it will be useful to takea general account of the whole amount of it in former times, to compareit with the present, and to do this every year in those cities where thecensus is yearly, [1308b] in larger communities once in three or fiveyears; and if the whole should be found much larger or much less than itwas at the time when the census was first established in the state,let there be a law either to extend or contract it, doing both theseaccording to its increase or decrease; if it increases making the censuslarger, if it decreases smaller: and if this latter is not done inoligarchies and free states, you will have a dynasty arise in the one,an oligarchy in the other: if the former is not, free states willbe changed into democracies, and oligarchies into free states ordemocracies. It is a general maxim in democracies, oligarchies,monarchies, and indeed in all governments, not to let any one acquire arank far superior to the rest of the community, but rather to endeavourto confer moderate honours for a continuance than great ones for a shorttime; for these latter spoil men, for it is not every one who can bearprosperity: but if this rule is not observed, let not those honourswhich were conferred all at once be all at once taken away, but ratherby degrees. But, above all things, let this regulation be made by thelaw, that no one shall have too much power, either by means of hisfortune or friends; but if he has, for his excess therein, let it becontrived that he shall quit the country. Now, as many persons promoteinnovations, that they may enjoy their own particular manner of living,there ought to be a particular officer to inspect the manners of everyone, and see that these are not contrary to the genius of the statein which he lives, whether it may be an oligarchy, a democracy, or anyother form of government; and, for the same reason, those should beguarded against who are most prosperous in the city: the means of doingwhich is by appointing those who are otherwise to the business and theoffices of the state. I mean, to oppose men of account to the commonpeople, the poor to the rich, and to blend both these into one body, andto increase the numbers of those who are in the middle rank; andthis will prevent those seditions which arise from an inequality ofcondition. But above all, in every state it is necessary, both by thelaws and every other method possible, to prevent those who are employedby the public from being venal, and this particularly in an oligarchy;for then the people will not be so much displeased from seeingthemselves excluded from a share in the government (nay, they willrather be glad to have leisure to attend their private affairs) as atsuspecting that the officers of the state steal the public money, thenindeed they are afflicted with double concern, both because they aredeprived of the honours of the state, and pillaged by those who enjoythem. There is one method of blending together a democracy and anaristocracy, [1309a] if office brought no profit; by which means boththe rich and the poor will enjoy what they desire; for to admit all toa share in the government is democratical; that the rich should bein office is aristocratical. This must be done by letting no publicemployment whatsoever be attended with any emolument; for the poor willnot desire to be in office when they can get nothing by it, but hadrather attend to their own affairs: but the rich will choose it, asthey want nothing of the community. Thus the poor will increase theirfortunes by being wholly employed in their own concerns; and theprincipal part of the people will not be governed by the lower sort.To prevent the exchequer from being defrauded, let all public money bedelivered out openly in the face of the whole city, and let copies ofthe accounts be deposited in the different wards tribes, and divisions.But, as the magistrates are to execute their offices without anyadvantages, the law ought to provide proper honours for those whoexecute them well. In democracies also it is necessary that the richshould be protected, by not permitting their lands to be divided, noreven the produce of them, which in some states is done unperceivably. Itwould be also better if the people would prevent them when they offer toexhibit a number of unnecessary and yet expensive public entertainmentsof plays, music, processions, and the like. In an oligarchy it isnecessary to take great care of the poor, and allot them publicemployments which are gainful; and, if any of the rich insult them, tolet their punishment be severer than if they insulted one of their ownrank; and to let estates pass by affinity, and not gift: nor to permitany person to have more than one; for by this means property will bemore equally divided, and the greater part of the poor get into bettercircumstances. It is also serviceable in a democracy and an oligarchyto allot those who take no part in public affairs an equality or apreference in other things; the rich in a democracy, to the poor in anoligarchy: but still all the principal offices in the state to be filledonly by those who are best qualified to discharge them.XThere are three qualifications necessary for those who fill thefirst departments in government; first of all, an affection for theestablished constitution; second place, abilities every way completelyequal to the business of their office; in the third, virtue and justicecorrespondent to the nature of that particular state they are placed in;for if justice is not the same in all states, it is evident that theremust be different species thereof. There may be some doubt, when allthese qualifications do not in the same persons, in what manner thechoice shall be made; as for instance, suppose that one person isan accomplished general, but a bad man and no friend to the [1309b]constitution; another is just and a friend to it, which shall oneprefer? we should then consider of two qualities, which of them thegenerality possess in a greater degree, which in a less; for whichreason in the choice of a general we should regard his courage more thanhis virtue as the more uncommon quality; as there are fewer capable ofconducting an army than there are good men: but, to protect the stateor manage the finances, the contrary rule should be followed; for theserequire greater virtue than the generality are possessed of, but onlythat knowledge which is common to all. It may be asked, if a man hasabilities equal to his appointment in the state, and is affectionate tothe constitution, what occasion is there for being virtuous, sincethese two things alone are sufficient to enable him to be useful tothe public? it is, because those who possess those qualities are oftendeficient in prudence; for, as they often neglect their own affairs,though they know them and love themselves, so nothing will prevent theirserving the public in the same manner. In short, whatsoever the lawscontain which we allow to be useful to the state contributes to itspreservation: but its first and principal support is (as has been ofteninsisted upon) to have the number of those who desire to preserve itgreater than those who wish to destroy it. Above all things that oughtnot to be forgotten which many governments now corrupted neglect;namely, to preserve a mean. For many things seemingly favourable to ademocracy destroy a democracy, and many things seemingly favourable toan oligarchy destroy an oligarchy. Those who think this the only virtueextend it to excess, not considering that as a nose which varies alittle from perfect straightness, either towards a hook nose or aflat one, may yet be beautiful and agreeable to look at; but if thisparticularity is extended beyond measure, first of all the properties ofthe part is lost, but at last it can hardly be admitted to be a nose atall, on account of the excess of the rise or sinking: thus it is withother parts of the human body; so also the same thing is true withrespect to states; for both an oligarchy and a democracy may somethingvary from their most perfect form and yet be well constituted; but ifany one endeavours to extend either of them too far, at first he willmake the government the worse for it, but at last there will be nogovernment at all remaining. The lawgiver and the politician thereforeshould know well what preserves and what destroys a democracy or anoligarchy, for neither the one nor the other can possibly continuewithout rich and poor: but that whenever an entire equality ofcircumstances [1310a] prevails, the state must necessarily become ofanother form; so that those who destroy these laws, which authorise aninequality in property, destroy the government. It is also an error indemocracies for the demagogues to endeavour to make the common peoplesuperior to the laws; and thus by setting them at variance with therich, dividing one city into two; whereas they ought rather to speakin favour of the rich. In oligarchies, on the contrary, it is wrong tosupport those who are in administration against the people. The oathsalso which they take in an oligarchy ought to be contrary to what theynow are; for, at present, in some places they swear, \"I will be adverseto the common people, and contrive all I can against them;\" whereas theyought rather to suppose and pretend the contrary; expressing in theiroaths, that they will not injure the people. But of all things which Ihave mentioned, that which contributes most to preserve the state is,what is now most despised, to educate your children for the state; forthe most useful laws, and most approved by every statesman, will be ofno service if the citizens are not accustomed to and brought up inthe principles of the constitution; of a democracy, if that is by lawestablished; of an oligarchy, if that is; for if there are bad moralsin one man, there are in the city. But to educate a child fit for thestate, it must not be done in the manner which would please either thosewho have the power in an oligarchy or those who desire a democracy, butso as they may be able to conduct either of these forms of governments.But now the children of the magistrates in an oligarchy are brought uptoo delicately, and the children of the poor hardy with exerciseand labour; so that they are both desirous of and able to promoteinnovations. In democracies of the purest form they pursue a methodwhich is contrary to their welfare; the reason of which is, that theydefine liberty wrong: now, there are two things which seem to be theobjects of a democracy, that the people in general should possess thesupreme power, and all enjoy freedom; for that which is just seems tobe equal, and what the people think equal, that is a law: now, theirfreedom and equality consists in every one's doing what they please:that is in such a democracy every one may live as he likes; \"as hisinclination guides,\" in the words of Euripides: but this is wrong, forno one ought to think it slavery to live in subjection to government,but protection. Thus I have mentioned the causes of corruption indifferent states, and the means of their preservation.CHAPTER XIt now remains that we speak of monarchies, their causes of corruption,and means of preservation; and indeed almost the same things which havebeen said of other governments happen to kingdoms and tyrannies; for akingdom partakes of an aristocracy, a tyranny of the worst species of anoligarchy and democracy; for which reason it is the worst that mancan submit to, as being composed of two, both of which are bad, andcollectively retains all the corruptions and all the defects of boththese states. These two species of monarchies arise from principlescontrary to each other: a kingdom is formed to protect the better sortof people against the multitude, and kings are appointed out of those,who are chosen either for their superior virtue and actions flowing fromvirtuous principles, or else from their noble descent; but a tyrant ischosen out of the meanest populace; an enemy to the better sort, thatthe common people may not be oppressed by them. That this is trueexperience convinces us; for the generality of tyrants were indeed meredemagogues, who gained credit with the people by oppressing the nobles.Some tyrannies were established in this manner after the cities wereconsiderably enlarged--others before that time, by kings who exceededthe power which their country allowed them, from a desire of governingdespotically: others were founded by those who were elected to thesuperior offices in the state; for formerly the people appointedofficers for life, who came to be at the head of civil and religiousaffairs, and these chose one out of their body in whom the supreme powerover all the magistrates was placed. By all these means it was easyto establish a tyranny, if they chose it; for their power was ready athand, either by their being kings, or else by enjoying the honours ofthe state; thus Phidon at Argos and other tyrants enjoyed originally thekingly power; Phalaris and others in Ionia, the honours of the state.Pansetius at Leontium, Cypselus at Corinth, Pisistratus at Athens,Dionysius at Syracuse, and others, acquired theirs by having beendemagogues. A kingdom, as we have said, partakes much of the nature ofan aristocracy, and is bestowed according to worth, as either virtue,family, beneficent actions, or these joined with power; for those whohave been benefactors to cities and states, or have it in their powersto be so, have acquired this honour, and those who have prevented apeople from falling into slavery by war, as Codrus, or those who havefreed them from it, as Cyrus, or the founders of cities, or settlers ofcolonies, as the kings of Sparta, Macedon, and Molossus. A king desiresto be the guardian of his people, that those who have property may besecure in the possession of it, and that the people in general meet withno injury; but a tyrant, as has been often said, has no regard to thecommon good, except for his own advantage; his only object is pleasure,but a king's is virtue: what a tyrant therefore is ambitious ofengrossing is wealth, but a king rather honour. The guards too of a kingare citizens, a tyrant's foreigners.That a tyranny contains all that is bad both in a democracy and anoligarchy is evident; with an oligarchy it has for its end gain, as theonly means of providing the tyrant with guards and the luxuries of life;like that it places no confidence in the people; and therefore deprivesthem of the use of arms: it is also common to them both to persecute thepopulace, to drive them out of the city and their own habitations. Witha democracy it quarrels with the nobles, and destroys them bothpublicly and privately, or drives them into banishment, as rivals andan impediment to the government; hence naturally arise conspiraciesboth amongst those who desire to govern and those who desire not to beslaves; hence arose Periander's advice to Thrasybulus to take off thetallest stalks, hinting thereby, that it was necessary to make away withthe eminent citizens. We ought then in reason, as has been alreadysaid, to account for the changes which arise in a monarchy from thesame causes which produce them in other states: for, through injusticereceived, fear, and contempt, many of those who are under a monarchicalgovernment conspire against it; but of all species of injustice,injurious contempt has most influence on them for that purpose:sometimes it is owing to their being deprived of their private fortunes.The dissolution too of a kingdom and a tyranny are generally the same;for monarchs abound in wealth and honour, which all are desirous toobtain. Of plots: some aim at the life of those who govern, others attheir government; the first arises from hatred to their persons; whichhatred may be owing to many causes, either of which will be sufficientto excite their anger, and the generality of those who are under theinfluence of that passion will join in a conspiracy, not for the sakeof their own advancement, but for revenge. Thus the plot againstthe children of Pisistratus arose from their injurious treatment ofHarmodius's sister, and insulting him also; for Harmodius resenting theinjury done to his sister, and Aristogiton the injury done to Harmodius.Periander the tyrant of Ambracia also lost his life by a conspiracy, forsome improper liberties he took with a boy in his cups: and Philip wasslain by Pausanias for neglecting to revenge him of the affront he hadreceived from Attains; as was Amintas the Little by Darda, for insultinghim on account of his age; and the eunuch by Evagoras the Cyprian inrevenge for having taken his son's wife away from him....Many also who have had their bodies scourged with stripes have, throughresentment, either killed those who caused them to be inflicted orconspired against them, even when they had kingly power, as at MityleneMegacles, joining with his friends, killed the Penthelidee, who usedto go about striking those they met with clubs. Thus, in later times,Smendes killed Penthilus for whipping him and dragging him away fromhis wife. Decamnichus also was the chief cause of the conspiracy againstArchelaus, for he urged others on: the occasion of his resentment washis having delivered him to Euripides the poet to be scourged; forEuripides was greatly offended with him for having said something of thefoulness of his breath. And many others have been killed or conspiredagainst on the same account. Fear too is a cause which produces thesame effects, as well in monarchies as in other states: thus Artabanesconspired against Xerxes through fear of punishment for having hangedDarius according to his orders, whom he supposed he intended to pardon,as the order was given at supper-time. Some kings also have been [1312a]dethroned and killed in consequence of the contempt they were held in bythe people; as some one conspired against Sardanapalus, having seen himspinning with his wife, if what is related of him is true, or if not ofhim, it may very probably be true of some one else. Dion also conspiredagainst Dionysius the Younger, seeing his subjects desirous of aconspiracy, and that he himself was always drunk: and even a man'sfriends will do this if they despise him; for from the confidence heplaces in them, they think that they shall not be found out. Thosealso who think they shall gain his throne will conspire against a kingthrough contempt; for as they are powerful themselves, and despise thedanger, on account of their own strength, they will readily attempt it.Thus a general at the head of his army will endeavour to dethrone themonarch, as Cyrus did Astyages, despising both his manner of life andhis forces; his forces for want of action, his life for its effeminacy:thus Suthes, the Thracian, who was general to Amadocus, conspiredagainst him. Sometimes more than one of these causes will excite mento enter into conspiracies, as contempt and desire of gain; as in theinstance of Mithridates against Ariobarzanes. Those also who are of abold disposition, and have gained military honours amongst kings, willof all others be most like to engage in sedition; for strength andcourage united inspire great bravery: whenever, therefore, these joinin one person, he will be very ready for conspiracies, as he will easilyconquer. Those who conspire against a tyrant through love of gloryand honour have a different motive in view from what I have alreadymentioned; for, like all others who embrace danger, they have only gloryand honour in view, and think, not as some do, of the wealth and pompthey may acquire, but engage in this as they would in any other nobleaction, that they may be illustrious and distinguished, and destroy atyrant, not to succeed in his tyranny, but to acquire renown. No doubtbut the number of those who act upon this principle is small, for wemust suppose they regard their own safety as nothing in case they shouldnot succeed, and must embrace the opinion of Dion (which few can do)when he made war upon Dionysius with a very few troops; for he said,that let the advantage he made be ever so little it would satisfy him tohave gained it; and that, should it be his lot to die the moment he hadgained footing in his country, he should think his death sufficientlyglorious. A tyranny also is exposed to the same destruction as all otherstates are, from too powerful neighbours: for it is evident, that anopposition of principles will make them desirous of subverting it;and what they desire, all who can, do: and there is a principle ofopposition in one state to another, as a democracy against a tyranny, assays Hesiod, \"a potter against a potter;\" for the extreme of a democracyis a tyranny; a kingly power against an aristocracy, from theirdifferent forms of government--for which reason the Lacedaemoniansdestroyed many tyrannies; as did the Syracusians during the prosperityof their state. Nor are they only destroyed from without, but alsofrom within, when those who have no share in the power bring about arevolution, as happened to Gelon, and lately to Dionysius; to the first,by means of Thrasybulus, the brother of Hiero, who nattered Gelon'sson, and induced him to lead a life of pleasure, that he himself mightgovern; but the family joined together and endeavoured to support thetyranny and expel Thrasybulus; but those whom they made of their partyseized the opportunity and expelled the whole family. Dion made waragainst his relation Dionysius, and being assisted by the people, firstexpelled and then killed him. As there are two causes which chieflyinduce men to conspire against tyrants, hatred and contempt, one ofthese, namely hatred, seems inseparable from them. Contempt also isoften the cause of their destruction: for though, for instance, thosewho raised themselves to the supreme power generally preserved it; butthose who received it from them have, to speak truth, almost immediatelyall of them lost it; for, falling into an effeminate way of life, theysoon grew despicable, and generally fell victims to conspiracies. Partof their hatred may be very fitly ascribed to anger; for in some casesthis is their motive to action: for it is often a cause which impelsthem to act more powerfully than hatred, and they proceed with greaterobstinacy against those whom they attack, as this passion is not underthe direction of reason. Many persons also indulge this passion throughcontempt; which occasioned the fall of the Pisistratidae and manyothers. But hatred is more powerful than anger; for anger is accompaniedwith grief, which prevents the entrance of reason; but hatred is freefrom it. In short, whatever causes may be assigned as the destructionof a pure oligarchy unmixed with any other government and an extremedemocracy, the same may be applied to a tyranny; for these are dividedtyrannies.Kingdoms are seldom destroyed by any outward attack; for which reasonthey are generally very stable; but they have many causes of subversionwithin; of which two are the principal; one is when those who arein power [1313a] excite a sedition, the other when they endeavour toestablish a tyranny by assuming greater power than the law gives them.A kingdom, indeed, is not what we ever see erected in our times, butrather monarchies and tyrannies; for a kingly government is one thatis voluntarily submitted to, and its supreme power admitted upon greatoccasions: but where many are equal, and there are none in any respectso much better than another as to be qualified for the greatness anddignity of government over them, then these equals will not willinglysubmit to be commanded; but if any one assumes the government, either byforce or fraud, this is a tyranny. To what we have already said we shalladd, the causes of revolutions in an hereditary kingdom. One of theseis, that many of those who enjoy it are naturally proper objects ofcontempt only: another is, that they are insolent while their power isnot despotic; but they possess kingly honours only. Such a state is soondestroyed; for a king exists but while the people are willing to obey,as their submission to him is voluntary, but to a tyrant involuntary.These and such-like are the causes of the destruction of monarchies.CHAPTER XIMonarchies, in a word, are preserved by means contrary to what I havealready mentioned as the cause of their destruction; but to speak toeach separately: the stability of a kingdom will depend upon the powerof the king's being kept within moderate bounds; for by how much theless extensive his power is, by so much the longer will his governmentcontinue; for he will be less despotic and more upon an equality ofcondition with those he governs; who, on that account, will envy him theless.It was on this account that the kingdom of the Molossi continued solong; and the Lacedaemonians from their government's being from thebeginning divided into two parts, and also by the moderation introducedinto the other parts of it by Theopompus, and his establishment of theephori; for by taking something from the power he increased the durationof the kingdom, so that in some measure he made it not less, but bigger;as they say he replied to his wife, who asked him if he was not ashamedto deliver down his kingdom to his children reduced from what hereceived it from his ancestors? No, says he, I give it him more lasting.Tyrannies are preserved two ways most opposite to each other, one ofwhich is when the power is delegated from one to the other, and in thismanner many tyrants govern in their states. Report says that Perianderfounded many of these. There are also many of them to be met withamongst the Persians. What has been already mentioned is as conduciveas anything can be to preserve a tyranny; namely, to keep down those whoare of an aspiring disposition, to take off those who will not submit,to allow no public meals, no clubs, no education, nothing at all, butto guard against everything that gives rise to high spirits or mutualconfidence; nor to suffer the learned meetings of those who are atleisure to hold conversation with each other; and to endeavour by everymeans possible to keep all the people strangers to each other; forknowledge increases mutual confidence; and to oblige all strangers toappear in public, and to live near the city-gate, that all their actionsmay be sufficiently seen; for those who are kept like slaves seldomentertain any noble thoughts: in short, to imitate everything which thePersians and barbarians do, for they all contribute to support slavery;and to endeavour to know what every one who is under their power doesand says; and for this purpose to employ spies: such were those womenwhom the Syracusians called potagogides Hiero also used to send outlisteners wherever there was any meeting or conversation; for the peopledare not speak with freedom for fear of such persons; and if any onedoes, there is the less chance of its being concealed; and to endeavourthat the whole community should mutually accuse and come to blows witheach other, friend with friend, the commons with the nobles, and therich with each other. It is also advantageous for a tyranny that allthose who are under it should be oppressed with poverty, that they maynot be able to compose a guard; and that, being employed in procuringtheir daily bread, they may have no leisure to conspire against theirtyrants. The Pyramids of Egypt are a proof of this, and the votiveedifices of the Cyposelidse, and the temple of Jupiter Olympus, built bythe Pisistratidae, and the works of Polycrates at Samos; for all theseproduced one end, the keeping the people poor. It is necessary also tomultiply taxes, as at Syracuse; where Dionysius in the space of fiveyears collected all the private property of his subjects into his owncoffers. A tyrant also should endeavour to engage his subjects in a war,that they may have employment and continually depend upon their general.A king is preserved by his friends, but a tyrant is of all persons theman who can place no confidence in friends, as every one has it in hisdesire and these chiefly in their power to destroy him. All these thingsalso which are done in an extreme democracy should be done in a tyranny,as permitting great licentiousness to the women in the house, that theymay reveal their husbands' secrets; and showing great indulgence toslaves also for the same reason; for slaves and women conspire notagainst tyrants: but when they are treated with kindness, both of themare abettors of tyrants, and extreme democracies also; and the peopletoo in such a state desire to be despotic. For which reason flatterersare in repute in both these: the demagogue in the democracy, for he isthe proper flatterer of the people; among tyrants, he who will servilelyadapt himself to their humours; for this is the business of [1314a]flatterers. And for this reason tyrants always love the worst ofwretches, for they rejoice in being flattered, which no man of a liberalspirit will submit to; for they love the virtuous, but flatter none. Badmen too are fit for bad purposes; \"like to like,\" as the proverb says. Atyrant also should show no favour to a man of worth or a freeman; for heshould think, that no one deserved to be thought these but himself; forhe who supports his dignity, and is a friend to freedom, encroaches uponthe superiority and the despotism of the tyrant: such men, therefore,they naturally hate, as destructive to their government. A tyrantalso should rather admit strangers to his table and familiarity thancitizens, as these are his enemies, but the others have no designagainst him. These and such-like are the supports of a tyranny, forit comprehends whatsoever is wicked. But all these things may becomprehended in three divisions, for there are three objects which atyranny has in view; one of which is, that the citizens should be ofpoor abject dispositions; for such men never propose to conspire againstany one. The second is, that they should have no confidence in eachother; for while they have not this, the tyrant is safe enough fromdestruction. For which reason they are always at enmity with those ofmerit, as hurtful to their government; not only as they scorn to begoverned despotically, but also because they can rely upon each other'sfidelity, and others can rely upon theirs, and because they will notinform against their associates, nor any one else. The third is, thatthey shall be totally without the means of doing anything; for no oneundertakes what is impossible for him to perform: so that without powera tyranny can never be destroyed. These, then, are the three objectswhich the inclinations of tyrants desire to see accomplished; for alltheir tyrannical plans tend to promote one of these three ends, thattheir people may neither have mutual confidence, power, nor spirit.This, then, is one of the two methods of preserving tyrannies: the otherproceeds in a way quite contrary to what has been already described,and which may be discerned from considering to what the destruction ofa kingdom is owing; for as one cause of that is, making the governmentapproach near to a tyranny, so the safety of a tyranny consists inmaking the government nearly kingly; preserving only one thing, namelypower, that not only the willing, but the unwilling also, must beobliged to submit; for if this is once lost, the tyranny is at an end.This, then, as the foundation, must be preserved: in other particularscarefully do and affect to seem like a king; first, appear to pay agreat attention [1314b] to what belongs to the public; nor make suchprofuse presents as will offend the people; while they are to supplythe money out of the hard labour of their own hands, and see it givenin profusion to mistresses, foreigners, and fiddlers; keeping an exactaccount both of what you receive and pay; which is a practice sometyrants do actually follow, by which means they seem rather fathers offamilies than tyrants: nor need you ever fear the want of money whileyou have the supreme power of the state in your own hands. It is alsomuch better for those tyrants who quit their kingdom to do this than toleave behind them money they have hoarded up; for their regents willbe much less desirous of making innovations, and they are more to bedreaded by absent tyrants than the citizens; for such of them as hesuspects he takes with him, but these regents must be left behind. Heshould also endeavour to appear to collect such taxes and require suchservices as the exigencies of the state demand, that whenever they arewanted they may be ready in time of war; and particularly to take carethat he appear to collect and keep them not as his own property, but thepublic's. His appearance also should not be severe, but respectable, sothat he should inspire those who approach him with veneration and notfear; but this will not be easily accomplished if he is despised. If,therefore, he will not take the pains to acquire any other, he ought toendeavour to be a man of political abilities, and to fix that opinion ofhimself in the judgment of his subjects. He should also take care not toappear to be guilty of the least offence against modesty, nor to sufferit in those under him: nor to permit the women of his family to treatothers haughtily; for the haughtiness of women has been the ruin of manytyrants. With respect to the pleasures of sense, he ought to do directlycontrary to the practice of some tyrants at present; for they do notonly continually indulge themselves in them for many days together, butthey seem also to desire to have other witnesses of it, that they maywonder at their happiness; whereas he ought really to be moderate inthese, and, if not, to appear to others to avoid them-for it is not thesober man who is exposed either to plots or contempt, but the drunkard;not the early riser, but the sluggard. His conduct in general shouldalso be contrary to what is reported of former tyrants; for he ought toimprove and adorn his city, so as to seem a guardian and not a tyrant;and, moreover., always to [1315a] seem particularly attentive to theworship of the gods; for from persons of such a character men entertainless fears of suffering anything illegal while they suppose that he whogoverns them is religious and reverences the gods; and they will be lessinclined to raise insinuations against such a one, as being peculiarlyunder their protection: but this must be so done as to give no occasionfor any suspicion of hypocrisy. He should also take care to show suchrespect to men of merit in every particular, that they should not thinkthey could be treated with greater distinction by their fellow-citizensin a free state. He should also let all honours flow immediately fromhimself, but every censure from his subordinate officers and judges. Itis also a common protection of all monarchies not to make one person toogreat, or, certainly, not many; for they will support each other: but,if it is necessary to entrust any large powers to one person, to takecare that it is not one of an ardent spirit; for this disposition isupon every opportunity most ready for a revolution: and, if it shouldseem necessary to deprive any one of his power, to do it by degrees,and not reduce him all at once. It is also necessary to abstain from allkinds of insolence; more particularly from corporal punishment; whichyou must be most cautious never to exercise over those who have adelicate sense of honour; for, as those who love money are touched tothe quick when anything affects their property, so are men of honour andprinciple when they receive any disgrace: therefore, either never employpersonal punishment, or, if you do, let it be only in the manner inwhich a father would correct his son, and not with contempt; and, uponthe whole, make amends for any seeming disgrace by bestowing greaterhonours. But of all persons who are most likely to entertain designsagainst the person of a tyrant, those are chiefly to be feared andguarded against who regard as nothing the loss of their own lives, sothat they can but accomplish their purpose: be very careful thereforeof those who either think themselves affronted, or those who are dearto them; for those who are excited by anger to revenge regard as nothingtheir own persons: for, as Heraclitus says, it is dangerous to fightwith an angry man who will purchase with his life the thing he aims at.As all cities are composed of two sorts of persons, the rich and thepoor, it is necessary that both these should find equal protection fromhim who governs them, and that the one party should not have it in theirpower to injure the other; but that the tyrant should attach to himselfthat party which is the most powerful; which, if he does, he will haveno occasion either to make his slaves free, or to deprive citizens oftheir arms; for the strength of either of the parties added to hisown forces will render him superior to any conspiracy. It would besuperfluous to go through all particulars; for the rule of conduct whichthe tyrant ought to pursue is evident enough, and that is, to affect toappear not the tyrant, but the king; the guardian of those he governs,not their plunderer, [1315b] but their protector, and to affectthe middle rank in life, not one superior to all others: he should,therefore, associate his nobles with him and soothe his people; for hisgovernment will not only be necessarily more honourable and worthy ofimitation, as it will be over men of worth, and not abject wretches whoperpetually both hate and fear him; but it will be also more durable.Let him also frame his life so that his manners may be consentaneousto virtue, or at least let half of them be so, that he may not bealtogether wicked, but only so in part.CHAPTER XIIIndeed an oligarchy and a tyranny are of all governments of the shortestduration. The tyranny of Orthagoras and his family at Sicyon, it istrue, continued longer than any other: the reason for which was, thatthey used their power with moderation, and were in many particularsobedient to the laws; and, as Clisthenes was an able general, he neverfell into contempt, and by the care he took that in many particulars hisgovernment should be popular. He is reported also to have presented aperson with a crown who adjudged the victory to another; and some saythat it is the statue of that judge which is placed in the forum.They say also, that Pisistratus submitted to be summoned into the courtof the Areopagites. The second that we shall mention is the tyranny ofthe Cypselidse, at Corinth, which continued seventy-seven years andsix months; for Cypselus was tyrant there thirty years, Perianderforty-four, and Psammetichus, the son of Georgias, three years; thereason for which was, that Cypselus was a popular man, and governedwithout guards. Periander indeed ruled like a tyrant, but then he was anable general. The third was that of the Pisistradidae at Athens; but itwas not continual: for Pisistratus himself was twice expelled; so thatout of thirty-three years he was only fifteen in power, and his soneighteen; so that the whole time was thirty-three years. Of the restwe shall mention that of Hiero, and Gelo at Syracuse; and this did notcontinue long, for both their reigns were only eighteen years; forGelo died in the eighth year of his tyranny, and Hiero in his tenth.Thrasybulus fell in his eleventh month, and many other tyrannies havecontinued a very short time. We have now gone through the general casesof corruption and [1316a] means of preservation both in free states andmonarchies. In Plato's Republic, Socrates is introduced treating uponthe changes which different governments are liable to: but his discourseis faulty; for he does not particularly mention what changes the bestand first governments are liable to; for he only assigns the generalcause, of nothing being immutable, but that in time everything willalter [***tr.: text is unintelligible here***] he conceives that naturewill then produce bad men, who will not submit to education, and inthis, probably, he is not wrong; for it is certain that there are somepersons whom it is impossible by any education to make good men; butwhy should this change be more peculiar to what he calls the best-formedgovernment, than to all other forms, and indeed to all other thingsthat exist? and in respect to his assigned time, as the cause of thealteration of all things, we find that those which did not beginto exist at the same time cease to be at the same time; so that, ifanything came into beginning the day before the solstice, it must alterat the same time. Besides, why should such a form of government bechanged into the Lacedaemonian? for, in general, when governments alter,they alter into the contrary species to what they before were, andnot into one like their former. And this reasoning holds true of otherchanges; for he says, that from the Lacedaemonian form it changes intoan oligarchy, and from thence into a democracy, and from a democracyinto a tyranny: and sometimes a contrary change takes place, as from ademocracy into an oligarchy, rather than into a monarchy. With respectto a tyranny he neither says whether there will be any change in it; orif not, to what cause it will be owing; or if there is, into what otherstate it will alter: but the reason of this is, that a tyranny is anindeterminate government; and, according to him, every state ought toalter into the first, and most perfect, thus the continuity and circlewould be preserved. But one tyranny often changed into another; asat Syria, from Myron's to Clisthenes'; or into an oligarchy, as wasAntileo's at Chalcas; or into a democracy, as was Gelo's at Syracuse; orinto an aristocracy, as was Charilaus's at Lacedaemon, and at Carthage.An oligarchy is also changed into a tyranny; such was the rise of mostof the ancient tyrannies in Sicily; at Leontini, into the tyranny ofPanaetius; at Gela, into that of Cleander; at Rhegium into that ofAnaxilaus; and the like in many other cities. It is absurd also tosuppose, that a state is changed into an oligarchy because those who arein power are avaricious and greedy of money, and not because those whoare by far richer than their fellow citizens think it unfair that thosewho have nothing should have an equal share in the rule of the statewith themselves, who possess so much-for in many oligarchies it is notallowable to be employed in money-getting, and there are many laws toprevent it. But in Carthage, which is a democracy, money-getting iscreditable, and yet their form of government remains unaltered. It isalso absurd to say, that in an oligarchy there are two cities, one ofthe poor and another of the rich; for why should this happen to themmore than to the Lacedaemonians, or any other state where all possessnot equal property, or where all are not equally good? for though noone member of the community should be poorer than he was before, yeta democracy might nevertheless change into an oligarchy; if the richshould be more powerful than the poor, and the one too negligent, andthe other attentive: and though these changes are owing to many causes,yet he mentions but one only, that the citizens become poor by luxury,and paying interest-money; as if at first they were all rich, or thegreater part of them: but this is not so, but when some of those whohave the principal management of public affairs lose their fortunes,they will endeavour to bring about a revolution; but when others do,nothing of consequence will follow, nor when such states do alter isthere any more reason for their altering into a democracy than anyother. Besides, though some of the members of the community may not havespent their fortunes, yet if they share not in the honours of the state,or if they are ill-used and insulted, they will endeavour to raiseseditions, and bring about a revolution, that they may be allowed to doas they like; which, Plato says, arises from too much liberty. Althoughthere are many oligarchies and democracies, yet Socrates, when he istreating of the changes they may undergo, speaks of them as if there wasbut one of each sort.BOOK VIWe have already shown what is the nature of the supreme council in thestate, and wherein one may differ from another, and how the differentmagistrates should be regulated; and also the judicial department, andwhat is best suited to what state; and also to what causes both thedestruction and preservation of governments are owing.As there are very many species of democracies, as well as of otherstates, it will not be amiss to consider at the same time anything whichwe may have omitted to mention concerning either of them, and to allotto each that mode of conduct which is peculiar to and advantageous forthem; and also to inquire into the combinations of all these differentmodes of government which we [1317a] have mentioned; for as these areblended together the government is altered, as from an aristocracy tobe an oligarchy, and from a free state to be a democracy. Now, I meanby those combinations of government (which I ought to examine into, buthave not yet done), namely, whether the deliberative department and theelection of magistrates is regulated in a manner correspondent to anoligarchy, or the judicial to an aristocracy, or the deliberative partonly to an oligarchy, and the election of magistrates to an aristocracy,or whether, in any other manner, everything is not regulated accordingto the nature of the government. But we will first consider whatparticular sort of democracy is fitted to a particular city, and alsowhat particular oligarchy to a particular people; and of other states,what is advantageous to what. It is also necessary to show clearly, notonly which of these governments is best for a state, but also howit ought to be established there, and other things we will treat ofbriefly.And first, we will speak of a democracy; and this will at the sametime show clearly the nature of its opposite which some persons callan oligarchy; and in doing this we must examine into all the parts ofa democracy, and everything that is connected therewith; for from themanner in which these are compounded together different species ofdemocracies arise: and hence it is that they are more than one, and ofvarious natures. Now, there are two causes which occasion there being somany democracies; one of which is that which we have already mentioned;namely, there being different sorts of people; for in one country themajority are husbandmen, in another mechanics, and hired servants; ifthe first of these is added to the second, and the third to both ofthem, the democracy will not only differ in the particular of better orworse, but in this, that it will be no longer the same government; theother is that which we will now speak of. The different things which areconnected with democracies and seem to make part of these states, do,from their being joined to them, render them different from others: thisattending a few, that more, and another all. It is necessary that he whowould found any state which he may happen to approve of, or correct one,should be acquainted with all these particulars. All founders of statesendeavour to comprehend within their own plan everything of nearly thesame kind with it; but in doing this they err, in the manner I havealready described in treating of the preservation and destruction ofgovernments. I will now speak of these first principles and manners, andwhatever else a democratical state requires.INow the foundation of a democratical state is liberty, and people havebeen accustomed to say this as if here only liberty was to be found; forthey affirm that this is the end proposed by every democracy. But onepart of liberty is to govern and be governed alternately; for, accordingto democratical justice, equality is measured by numbers, and not byworth: and this being just, it is necessary that the supreme powershould be vested in the people at large; and that what the majoritydetermine should be final: so that in a democracy the poor ought to havemore power than the rich, as being the greater number; for this is onemark of liberty which all framers of a democracy lay down as a criterionof that state; another is, to live as every one likes; for this, theysay, is a right which liberty gives, since he is a slave who must liveas he likes not. This, then, is another criterion of a democracy. Hencearises the claim to be under no command whatsoever to any one, upon anyaccount, any otherwise than by rotation, and that just as far only asthat person is, in his turn, under his also. This also is conducive tothat equality which liberty demands. These things being premised, andsuch being the government, it follows that such rules as the followingshould be observed in it, that all the magistrates should be chosen outof all the people, and all to command each, and each in his turn all:that all the magistrates should be chosen by lot, except to thoseoffices only which required some particular knowledge and skill: that nocensus, or a very small one, should be required to qualify a man for anyoffice: that none should be in the same employment twice, or very few,and very seldom, except in the army: that all their appointments shouldbe limited to a very short time, or at least as many as possible:that the whole community should be qualified to judge in all causeswhatsoever, let the object be ever so extensive, ever so interesting, orof ever so high a nature; as at Athens, where the people at large judgethe magistrates when they come out of office, and decide concerningpublic affairs as well as private contracts: that the supreme powershould be in the public assembly; and that no magistrate should beallowed any discretionary power but in a few instances, and of noconsequence to public business. Of all magistrates a senate is bestsuited to a democracy, where the whole community is not paid for givingtheir attendance; for in that case it loses its power; for then thepeople will bring all causes before them, by appeal, as we havealready mentioned in a former book. In the next place, there should, ifpossible, be a fund to pay all the citizens--who have any share in themanagement of public affairs, either as members of the assembly, judges,and magistrates; but if this cannot be done, at least the magistrates,the judges the senators, and members of the supreme assembly, and alsothose officers who are obliged to eat at a common table ought to bepaid. Moreover, as an oligarchy is said to be a government of men offamily, fortune, and education; so, on the contrary, a democracy is agovernment in the hands of men of no birth, indigent circumstances, andmechanical employments. In this state also no office [1318a] should befor life; and, if any such should remain after the government has beenlong changed into a democracy, they should endeavour by degrees todiminish the power; and also elect by lot instead of vote. These things,then, appertain to all democracies; namely, to be established on thatprinciple of justice which is homogeneous to those governments; that is,that all the members of the state, by number, should enjoy an equality,which seems chiefly to constitute a democracy, or government of thepeople: for it seems perfectly equal that the rich should have no moreshare in the government than the poor, nor be alone in power; but thatall should be equal, according to number; for thus, they think, theequality and liberty of the state best preserved.IIIn the next place we must inquire how this equality is to be procured.Shall the qualifications be divided so that five hundred rich should beequal to a thousand poor, or shall the thousand have equal power withthe five hundred? or shall we not establish our equality in this manner?but divide indeed thus, and afterwards taking an equal number both outof the five hundred and the thousand, invest them with the power ofcreating the magistrates and judges. Is this state then establishedaccording to perfect democratical justice, or rather that which isguided by numbers only? For the defenders of a democracy say, that thatis just which the majority approve of: but the favourers of an oligarchysay, that that is just which those who have most approve of; and that weought to be directed by the value of property. Both the propositions areunjust; for if we agree with what the few propose we erect a tyranny:for if it should happen that an individual should have more than therest who are rich, according to oligarchical justice, this man alonehas a right to the supreme power; but if superiority of numbers is toprevail, injustice will then be done by confiscating the property of therich, who are few, as we have already said. What then that equality is,which both parties will admit, must be collected from the definitionof right which is common to them both; for they both say that what themajority of the state approves of ought to be established. Be it so; butnot entirely: but since a city happens to be made up of two differentranks of people, the rich and the poor, let that be established whichis approved of by both these, or the greater part: but should there beopposite sentiments, let that be established which shall be approvedof by the greater part: but let this be according to the census; forinstance, if there should be ten of the rich and twenty of the poor, andsix of the first and fifteen of the last should agree upon any measure,and the remaining four of the rich should join with the remaining fiveof the poor in opposing it, that party whose census when added togethershould determine which opinion should be law, and should these happento be equal, it should be regarded as a case similar to an assembly orcourt of justice dividing equally upon any question that comes beforethem, who either determine it by lot or some such method. But although,with [1318b] respect to what is equal and just, it may be very difficultto establish the truth, yet it is much easier to do than to persuadethose who have it in their power to encroach upon others to be guidedthereby; for the weak always desire what is equal and just, but thepowerful pay no regard thereunto.VThere are four kinds of democracies. The best is that which is composedof those first in order, as we have already said, and this also is themost ancient of any. I call that the first which every one would placeso, was he to divide the people; for the best part of these are thehusbandmen. We see, then, that a democracy may be framed where themajority live by tillage or pasturage; for, as their property isbut small, they will not be at leisure perpetually to hold publicassemblies, but will be continually employed in following their ownbusiness, not having otherwise the means of living; nor will they bedesirous of what another enjoys, but will rather like to follow theirown business than meddle with state affairs and accept the offices ofgovernment, which will be attended with no great profit; for the majorpart of mankind are rather desirous of riches than honour (a proof ofthis is, that they submitted to the tyrannies in ancient times, and donow submit to the oligarchies, if no one hinders them in their usualoccupations, or deprives them of their property; for some of them soonget rich, others are removed from poverty); besides, their having theright of election and calling their magistrates to account for theirconduct when they come out of office, will satisfy their desire ofhonours, if any of them entertain that passion: for in some states,though the commonalty have not the right of electing the magistrates,yet it is vested in part of that body chosen to represent them: and itis sufficient for the people at large to possess the deliberative power:and this ought to be considered as a species of democracy; such was thatformerly at Mantinsea: for which reason it is proper for the democracywe have been now treating of to have a power (and it has been usual forthem to have it) of censuring their magistrates when out of office,and sitting in judgment upon all causes: but that the chief magistratesshould be elected, and according to a certain census, which should varywith the rank of their office, or else not by a census, but accordingto their abilities for their respective appointments. A state thusconstituted must be well constituted; for the magistracies will bealways filled with the best men with the approbation of the people;who will not envy their superiors: and these and the nobles shouldbe content with this part in the administration; for they will not begoverned by their inferiors. They will be also careful to use theirpower with moderation, as there are others to whom full power isdelegated to censure their conduct; for it is very serviceable to thestate to have them dependent upon others, and not to be permitted to dowhatsoever they choose; for with such a liberty there would be no checkto that evil particle there is in every one: therefore it is [1319a]necessary and most for the benefit of the state that the offices thereofshould be filled by the principal persons in it, whose characters areunblemished, and that the people are not oppressed. It is now evidentthat this is the best species of democracy, and on what account; becausethe people are such and have such powers as they ought to have. Toestablish a democracy of husbandmen some of those laws which wereobserved in many ancient states are universally useful; as, forinstance, on no account to permit any one to possess more than a certainquantity of land, or within a certain distance from the city. Formerlyalso, in some states, no one was allowed to sell their original lot ofland. They also mention a law of one Oxylus, which forbade any one toadd to their patrimony by usury. We ought also to follow the law ofthe Aphutaeans, as useful to direct us in this particular we are nowspeaking of; for they having but very little ground, while they werea numerous people, and at the same time were all husbandmen, did notinclude all their lands within the census, but divided them in such amanner that, according to the census, the poor had more power thanthe rich. Next to the commonalty of husbandmen is one of shepherds andherdsmen; for they have many things in common with them, and, by theirway of life, are excellently qualified to make good soldiers, stout inbody, and able to continue in the open air all night. The generality ofthe people of whom other democracies are composed are much worse thanthese; for their lives are wretched nor have they any business withvirtue in anything they do; these are your mechanics, your exchange-men,and hired servants; as all these sorts of men frequent the exchange andthe citadel, they can readily attend the public assembly; whereas thehusbandmen, being more dispersed in the country, cannot so easily meettogether; nor are they equally desirous of doing it with these others!When a country happens to be so situated that a great part of the landlies at a distance from the city, there it is easy to establish a gooddemocracy or a free state for the people in general will be obliged tolive in the country; so that it will be necessary in such a democracy,though there may be an exchange-mob at hand, never to allow a legalassembly without the inhabitants of the country attend. We have shown inwhat manner the first and best democracy ought to be established, and itwill be equally evident as to the rest, for from these we [1319b] shouldproceed as a guide, and always separate the meanest of the people fromthe rest. But the last and worst, which gives to every citizen withoutdistinction a share in every part of the administration, is what fewcitizens can bear, nor is it easy to preserve for any long time, unlesswell supported by laws and manners. We have already noticed almost everycause that can destroy either this or any other state. Those who havetaken the lead in such a democracy have endeavoured to support it, andmake the people powerful by collecting together as many persons as theycould and giving them their freedom, not only legitimately but naturallyborn, and also if either of their parents were citizens, that is to say,if either their father or mother; and this method is better suited tothis state than any other: and thus the demagogues have usually managed.They ought, however, to take care, and do this no longer than the commonpeople are superior to the nobles and those of the middle rank, andthen stop; for, if they proceed still further, they will make thestate disorderly, and the nobles will ill brook the power of the commonpeople, and be full of resentment against it; which was the cause ofan insurrection at Cyrene: for a little evil is overlooked, but when itbecomes a great one it strikes the eye. It is, moreover, very-useful insuch a state to do as Clisthenes did at Athens, when he was desirous ofincreasing the power of the people, and as those did who established thedemocracy in Cyrene; that is, to institute many tribes and fraternities,and to make the religious rites of private persons few, and thosecommon; and every means is to be contrived to associate and blend thepeople together as much as possible; and that all former customs bebroken through. Moreover, whatsoever is practised in a tyrannyseems adapted to a democracy of this species; as, for instance, thelicentiousness of the slaves, the women, and the children; for this toa certain degree is useful in such a state; and also to overlook everyone's living as they choose; for many will support such a government:for it is more agreeable to many to live without any control than asprudence would direct.CHAPTER VIt is also the business of the legislator and all those who wouldsupport a government of this sort not to make it too great a work, ortoo perfect; but to aim only to render it stable: for, let a state beconstituted ever so badly, there is no difficulty in its continuing afew days: they should therefore endeavour to procure its safety byall those ways which we have described in assigning the causes of thepreservation and destruction of governments; avoiding what is hurtful,and by framing such laws, written and unwritten, as contain those thingswhich chiefly tend to the preservation of the state; nor to suppose thatthat is useful either for a democratic or [1320a] an oligarchic form ofgovernment which contributes to make them more purely so, but what willcontribute to their duration: but our demagogues at present, to flatterthe people, occasion frequent confiscations in the courts; for whichreason those who have the welfare of the state really at heart shouldact directly opposite to what they do, and enact a law to preventforfeitures from being divided amongst the people or paid into thetreasury, but to have them set apart for sacred uses: for those whoare of a bad disposition would not then be the less cautious, as theirpunishment would be the same; and the community would not be so ready tocondemn those whom they sat in judgment on when they were to get nothingby it: they should also take care that the causes which are broughtbefore the public should be as few as possible, and punish with theutmost severity those who rashly brought an action against any one; forit is not the commons but the nobles who are generally prosecuted: forin all things the citizens of the same state ought to be affectionate toeach other, at least not to treat those who have the chief power init as their enemies. Now, as the democracies which have been latelyestablished are very numerous, and it is difficult to get the commonpeople to attend the public assemblies without they are paid for it,this, when there is not a sufficient public revenue, is fatal to thenobles; for the deficiencies therein must be necessarily made up bytaxes, confiscations, and fines imposed by corrupt courts of justice:which things have already destroyed many democracies. Whenever, then,the revenues of the state are small, there should be but few publicassemblies and but few courts of justice: these, however, should havevery extensive jurisdictions, but should continue sitting a few daysonly, for by this means the rich would not fear the expense, althoughthey should receive nothing for their attendance, though the poor did;and judgment also would be given much better; for the rich will notchoose to be long absent from their own affairs, but will willinglybe so for a short time: and, when there are sufficient revenues, adifferent conduct ought to be pursued from what the demagogues atpresent follow; for now they divide the surplus of the public moneyamongst the poor; these receive it and again want the same supply, whilethe giving it is like pouring water into a sieve: but the true patriotin a democracy ought to take care that the majority of the community arenot too poor, for this is the cause of rapacity in that government; hetherefore should endeavour that they may enjoy perpetual plenty; andas this also is advantageous to the rich, what can be saved out of thepublic money should be put by, and then divided at once amongst thepoor, if possible, in such a quantity as may enable every one of them topurchase a little field, and, if that cannot be done, at least to giveeach of them enough to procure the implements [1320b] of trade andhusbandry; and if there is not enough for all to receive so much atonce, then to divide it according to tribes or any other allotment. Inthe meantime let the rich pay them for necessary services, but not beobliged to find them in useless amusements. And something like thiswas the manner in which they managed at Carthage, and preserved theaffections of the people; for by continually sending some of theircommunity into colonies they procured plenty. It is also worthy of asensible and generous nobility to divide the poor amongst them, andsupplying them with what is necessary, induce them to work; or toimitate the conduct of the people at Tarentum: for they, permitting thepoor to partake in common of everything which is needful for them, gainthe affections of the commonalty. They have also two different ways ofelecting their magistrates; for some are chosen by vote, others bylot; by the last, that the people at large may have some share in theadministration; by the former, that the state may be well governed: thesame may be accomplished if of the same magistrates you choose some byvote, others by lot. And thus much for the manner in which democraciesought to be established.CHAPTER VIWhat has been already said will almost of itself sufficiently show howan oligarchy ought to be founded; for he who would frame such a stateshould have in his view a democracy to oppose it; for every species ofoligarchy should be founded on principles diametrically opposite to somespecies of democracy.The first and best-framed oligarchy is that which approaches near towhat we call a free state; in which there ought to be two differentcensus, the one high, the other low: from those who are within thelatter the ordinary officers of the state ought to be chosen; from theformer the supreme magistrates: nor should any one be excluded from apart of the administration who was within the census; which should beso regulated that the commonalty who are included in it should by meansthereof be superior to those who have no share in the government; forthose who are to have the management of public affairs ought always tobe chosen out of the better sort of the people. Much in the same mannerought that oligarchy to be established which is next in order: but as tothat which is most opposite to a pure democracy, and approaches nearestto a dynasty and a tyranny, as it is of all others the worst, so itrequires the greatest care and caution to preserve it: for as bodies ofsound and healthy constitutions and ships which are well manned andwell found for sailing can bear many injuries without perishing, whilea diseased body or a leaky ship with an indifferent crew cannot supportthe [1321a] least shock; so the worst-established governments want mostlooking after. A number of citizens is the preservation of a democracy;for these are opposed to those rights which are founded in rank: onthe contrary, the preservation of an oligarchy depends upon the dueregulation of the different orders in the society.CHAPTER VIIAs the greater part of the community are divided into four sorts ofpeople; husbandmen, mechanics, traders, and hired servants; and as thosewho are employed in war may likewise be divided into four; the horsemen,the heavy-armed soldier, the light-armed, and the sailor, where thenature of the country can admit a great number of horse; there apowerful oligarchy may be easily established: for the safety of theinhabitants depends upon a force of that sort; but those who can supportthe expense of horsemen must be persons of some considerable fortune.Where the troops are chiefly heavy-armed, there an oligarchy, inferiorin power to the other, may be established; for the heavy-armed arerather made up of men of substance than the poor: but the light-armedand the sailors always contribute to support a democracy: but where thenumber of these is very great and a sedition arises, the other parts ofthe community fight at a disadvantage; but a remedy for this evil isto be learned from skilful generals, who always mix a proper number oflight-armed soldiers with their horse and heavy-armed: for it is withthose that the populace get the better of the men of fortune in aninsurrection; for these being lighter are easily a match for the horseand the heavy-armed: so that for an oligarchy to form a body of troopsfrom these is to form it against itself: but as a city is composed ofpersons of different ages, some young and some old, the fathers shouldteach their sons, while they were very young, a light and easy exercise;but, when they are grown up, they should be perfect in every warlikeexercise. Now, the admission of the people to any share in thegovernment should either be (as I said before) regulated by a census, orelse, as at Thebes, allowed to those who for a certain time have ceasedfrom any mechanic employment, or as at Massalia, where they are chosenaccording to their worth, whether citizens or foreigners. With respectto the magistrates of the highest rank which it may be necessary tohave in a state, the services they are bound to do the public should beexpressly laid down, to prevent the common people from being desirousof accepting their employments, and also to induce them to regard theirmagistrates with favour when they know what a price they pay for theirhonours. It is also necessary that the magistrates, upon entering intotheir offices, should make magnificent sacrifices and erect some publicstructure, that the people partaking of the entertainment, and seeingthe city ornamented with votive gifts in their temples and publicstructures, may see with pleasure the stability of the government: addto this also, that the nobles will have their generosity recorded: butnow this is not the conduct which those who are at present at the headof an oligarchy pursue, but the contrary; for they are not more desirousof honour than of gain; for which reason such oligarchies may moreproperly be called little democracies. Thus [1321b] we have explained onwhat principles a democracy and an oligarchy ought to be established.CHAPTER VIIIAfter what has been said I proceed next to treat particularly of themagistrates; of what nature they should be, how many, and for whatpurpose, as I have already mentioned: for without necessary magistratesno state can exist, nor without those which contribute to its dignityand good order can exist happily: now it is necessary that in smallstates the magistrates should be few; in a large one, many: also toknow well what offices may be joined together, and what ought to beseparated. The first thing necessary is to establish proper regulatorsin the markets; for which purpose a certain magistrate should beappointed to inspect their contracts and preserve good order; for ofnecessity, in almost every city there must be both buyers and sellers tosupply each other's mutual wants: and this is what is most productiveof the comforts of life; for the sake of which men seem to have joinedtogether in one community. A second care, and nearly related to thefirst, is to have an eye both to the public and private edifices inthe city, that they may be an ornament; and also to take care of allbuildings which are likely to fall: and to see that the highways arekept in proper repair; and also that the landmarks between differentestates are preserved, that there may be no disputes on that account;and all other business of the same nature. Now, this business may bedivided into several branches, over each of which in populous citiesthey appoint a separate person; one to inspect the buildings, anotherthe fountains, another the harbours; and they are called the inspectorsof the city. A third, which is very like the last, and conversant nearlyabout the same objects, only in the country, is to take care of whatis done out of the city. The officers who have this employment we callinspectors of the lands, or inspectors of the woods; but the businessof all three of them is the same. There must also be other officersappointed to receive the public revenue and to deliver it out to thosewho are in the different departments of the state: these are calledreceivers or quaestors. There must also be another, before whom allprivate contracts and sentences of courts should be enrolled, as wellas proceedings and declarations. Sometimes this employment is dividedamongst many, but there is one supreme over the rest; these are calledproctors, notaries, and the like. Next to these is an officer whosebusiness is of all others the most necessary, and yet most difficult;namely, to take care that sentence is executed upon those who arecondemned; and that every one pays the fines laid on him; and also tohave the charge of those who are in prison. [1322a] This office is verydisagreeable on account of the odium attending it, so that no one willengage therein without it is made very profitable, or, if they do,will they be willing to execute it according to law; but it is mostnecessary, as it is of no service to pass judgment in any cause withoutthat judgment is carried into execution: for without this human societycould not subsist: for which reason it is best that this office shouldnot be executed by one person, but by some of the magistrates of theother courts. In like manner, the taking care that those fines whichare ordered by the judges are levied should be divided amongst differentpersons. And as different magistrates judge different causes, let thecauses of the young be heard by the young: and as to those which arealready brought to a hearing, let one person pass sentence, and anothersee it executed: as, for instance, let the magistrates who have the careof the public buildings execute the sentence which the inspectors ofthe markets have passed, and the like in other cases: for by so much theless odium attends those who carry the laws into execution, by so muchthe easier will they be properly put in force: therefore for the samepersons to pass the sentence and to execute it will subject them togeneral hatred; and if they pass it upon all, they will be consideredas the enemies of all. Thus one person has often the custody of theprisoner's body, while another sees the sentence against him executed,as the eleven did at Athens: for which reason it is prudent to separatethese offices, and to give great attention thereunto as equallynecessary with anything we have already mentioned; for it will certainlyhappen that men of character will decline accepting this office, andworthless persons cannot properly be entrusted with it, as havingthemselves rather an occasion for a guard than being qualified to guardothers. This, therefore, ought by no means to be a separate office fromothers; nor should it be continually allotted to any individuals, butthe young men; where there is a city-guard, the youths ought in turnsto take these offices upon them. These, then, as the most necessarymagistrates, ought to be first mentioned: next to these are others noless necessary, but of much higher rank, for they ought to be men ofgreat skill and fidelity. These are they who have the guard of the city,and provide everything that is necessary for war; whose business it is,both in war and peace, to defend the walls and the gates, and to takecare to muster and marshal the citizens. Over all these there aresometimes more officers, sometimes fewer: thus in little cities there isonly one whom they call either general or polemarch; but where there arehorse and light-armed troops, and bowmen, and sailors, they sometimesput distinct commanders over each of these; who again have others underthem, according to their different divisions; all of which join togetherto make one military body: and thus much for this department. Since someof the magistrates, if not all, have business with the public money,it is necessary that there should be other officers, whose employmentshould be nothing else than to take an account of what they have, andcorrect any mismanagement therein. But besides all these magistratesthere is one who is supreme over them all, who very often has in his ownpower the disposal of the public revenue and taxes; who presides overthe people when the supreme power is in them; for there must be somemagistrate who has a power to summon them together, and to preside ashead of the state. These are sometimes called preadvisers; but wherethere are many, more properly a council. These are nearly the civilmagistrates which are requisite to a government: but there are otherpersons whose business is confined to religion; as the priests, andthose who are to take care of the temples, that they are kept in properrepair, or, if they fall down, that they may be rebuilt; and whateverelse belongs to public worship. This charge is sometimes entrusted toone person, as in very small cities: in others it is delegated to many,and these distinct from the priesthood, as the builders or keepers ofholy places, and officers of the sacred revenue. Next to these arethose who are appointed to have the general care of all those publicsacrifices to the tutelar god of the state, which the laws do notentrust to the priests: and these in different states have differentappellations. To enumerate in few words the different departments ofall those magistrates who are necessary: these are either religion,war, taxes, expenditures, markets, public buildings, harbours, highways.Belonging to the courts of justice there are scribes to enroll privatecontracts; and there must also be guards set over the prisoners, othersto see the law is executed, council on either side, and also others towatch over the conduct of those who are to decide the causes. Amongstthe magistrates also may finally be reckoned those who are to give theiradvice in public affairs. But separate states, who are peculiarly happyand have leisure to attend to more minute particulars, and are veryattentive to good order, require particular magistrates for themselves;such as those who have the government of the women; who are to see thelaws are executed; who take care of the boys and preside over theireducation. To these may be added those who have the care of theirgymnastic exercises, [1323a] their theatres, and every other publicspectacle which there may happen to be. Some of these, however, are notof general use; as the governors of the women: for the poor are obligedto employ their wives and children in servile offices for want ofslaves. As there are three magistrates to whom some states entrust thesupreme power; namely, guardians of the laws, preadvisers, and senators;guardians of the laws suit best to an aristocracy, preadvisers to anoligarchy, and a senate to a democracy. And thus much briefly concerningall magistrates.BOOK VIIHe who proposes to make that inquiry which is necessary concerning whatgovernment is best, ought first to determine what manner of living ismost eligible; for while this remains uncertain it will also be equallyuncertain what government is best: for, provided no unexpected accidentsinterfere, it is highly probable, that those who enjoy the bestgovernment will live the most happily according to their circumstances;he ought, therefore, first to know what manner of life is most desirablefor all; and afterwards whether this life is the same to the man andthe citizen, or different. As I imagine that I have already sufficientlyshown what sort of life is best in my popular discourses on thatsubject, I think I may very properly repeat the same here; as mostcertainly no one ever called in question the propriety of one of thedivisions; namely, that as what is good, relative to man, may be dividedinto three sorts, what is external, what appertains to the body, andwhat to the soul, it is evident that all these must conspire to makea man happy: for no one would say that a man was happy who had nofortitude, no temperance, no justice, no prudence; but was afraid of theflies that flew round him: nor would abstain from the meanest theft ifhe was either hungry or dry, or would murder his dearest friend fora farthing; and also was in every particular as wanting in hisunderstanding as an infant or an idiot. These truths are so evident thatall must agree to them; though some may dispute about the quantity andthe degree: for they may think, that a very little virtue is sufficientfor happiness; but for riches, property, power, honour, and all suchthings, they endeavour to increase them without bounds: but to such wereply, that it is easy to prove from what experience teaches us in thesecases, that these external goods produce not virtue, but virtue them.As to a happy life, whether it is to be found in pleasure or virtue orboth, certain it is, that those whose morals are most pure, and whoseunderstandings are best cultivated, will enjoy more of it, althoughtheir fortune is but moderate than those do who own an exuberance ofwealth, are deficient in those; and this utility any one who reflectsmay easily convince himself of; for whatsoever is external has itsboundary, as a machine, and whatsoever is useful in its excess is eithernecessarily hurtful, or at best useless to the possessor; but every goodquality of the soul the higher it is in degree, so much the more usefulit is, if it is permitted on this subject to use the word useful as wellas noble. It is also very evident, that the accidents of each subjecttake place of each other, as the subjects themselves, of which we allowthey are accidents, differ from each other in value; so that if the soulis more noble than any outward possession, as the body, both in itselfand with respect to us, it must be admitted of course that the bestaccidents of each must follow the same analogy. Besides, it is for thesake of the soul that these things are desirable; and it is on thisaccount that wise men should desire them, not the soul for them. Let ustherefore be well assured, that every one enjoys as much happiness as hepossesses virtue and wisdom, and acts according to their dictates; sincefor this we have the example of GOD Himself, _who is completely happy,not from any external good, but in Himself, and because such is Hisnature_. For good fortune is something different from happiness, as everygood which depends not on the mind is owing to chance or fortune; butit is not from fortune that any one is wise and just: hence it follows,that that city is happiest which is the best and acts best: for no onecan do well who acts not well; nor can the deeds either of man or citybe praiseworthy without virtue and wisdom; for whatsoever is just, orwise, or prudent in a man, the same things are just, wise, and prudentin a city.Thus much by way of introduction; for I could not but just touch uponthis subject, though I could not go through a complete investigationof it, as it properly belongs to another question: let us at presentsuppose so much, that a man's happiest life, both as an individual andas a citizen, is a life of virtue, accompanied with those enjoymentswhich virtue usually procures. If [1324a] there are any who are notconvinced by what I have said, their doubts shall be answered hereafter,at present we shall proceed according to our intended method.IIt now remains for us to say whether the happiness of any individualman and the city is the same or different: but this also is evident; forwhosoever supposes that riches will make a person happy, must place thehappiness of the city in riches if it possesses them; those who prefer alife which enjoys a tyrannic power over others will also think, that thecity which has many others under its command is most happy: thus alsoif any one approves a man for his virtue, he will think the most worthycity the happiest: but here there are two particulars which requireconsideration, one of which is, whether it is the most eligible lifeto be a member of the community and enjoy the rights of a citizen, orwhether to live as a stranger, without interfering in public affairs;and also what form of government is to be preferred, and whatdisposition of the state is best; whether the whole community should beeligible to a share in the administration, or only the greater part, andsome only: as this, therefore, is a subject of political examinationand speculation, and not what concerns the individual, and the first ofthese is what we are at present engaged in, the one of these I am notobliged to speak to, the other is the proper business of my presentdesign. It is evident that government must be the best which is soestablished, that every one therein may have it in his power to actvirtuously and live happily: but some, who admit that a life of virtueis most eligible, still doubt which is preferable a public life ofactive virtue, or one entirely disengaged from what is without andspent in contemplation; which some say is the only one worthy of aphilosopher; and one of these two different modes of life both nowand formerly seem to have been chosen by all those who were the mostvirtuous men; I mean the public or philosophic. And yet it is of nolittle consequence on which side the truth lies; for a man of sensemust naturally incline to the better choice; both as an individual and acitizen. Some think that a tyrannic government over those near us isthe greatest injustice; but that a political one is not unjust: but thatstill is a restraint on the pleasures and tranquillity of life. Othershold the quite contrary opinion, and think that a public and active lifeis the only life for man: for that private persons have no opportunityof practising any one virtue, more than they have who are engagedin public life the management of the [1324b] state. These are theirsentiments; others say, that a tyrannical and despotical mode ofgovernment is the only happy one; for even amongst some free states theobject of their laws seems to be to tyrannise over their neighbours: sothat the generality of political institutions, wheresoever dispersed,if they have any one common object in view, have all of them this,to conquer and govern. It is evident, both from the laws of theLacedaemonians and Cretans, as well as by the manner in which theyeducated their children, that all which they had in view was to makethem soldiers: besides, among all nations, those who have power enoughand reduce others to servitude are honoured on that account; as were theScythians, Persians, Thracians, and Gauls: with some there are laws toheighten the virtue of courage; thus they tell us that at Carthage theyallowed every person to wear as many rings for distinction as he hadserved campaigns. There was also a law in Macedonia, that a man who hadnot himself killed an enemy should be obliged to wear a halter; amongthe Scythians, at a festival, none were permitted to drink out ofthe cup was carried about who had not done the same thing. Among theIberians, a warlike nation, they fixed as many columns upon a man's tombas he had slain enemies: and among different nations different thingsof this sort prevail, some of them established by law, others by custom.Probably it may seem too absurd to those who are willing to take thissubject into their consideration to inquire whether it is the businessof a legislator to be able to point out by what means a state may governand tyrannise over its neighbours, whether they will, or will not: forhow can that belong either to the politician or legislator which isunlawful? for that cannot be lawful which is done not only justly, butunjustly also: for a conquest may be unjustly made. But we see nothingof this in the arts: for it is the business neither of the physician northe pilot to use either persuasion or force, the one to his patients,the other to his passengers: and yet many seem to think a despoticgovernment is a political one, and what they would not allow to be justor proper, if exercised over themselves, they will not blush to exerciseover others; for they endeavour to be wisely governed themselves, butthink it of no consequence whether others are so or not: but a despoticpower is absurd, except only where nature has framed the one party fordominion, the other for subordination; and therefore no one ought toassume it over all in general, but those only which are the properobjects thereof: thus no one should hunt men either for food orsacrifice, but what is fit for those purposes, and these are wildanimals which are eatable.Now a city which is well governed might be very [1325a] happy in itselfwhile it enjoyed a good system of laws, although it should happen to beso situated as to have no connection with any other state, though itsconstitution should not be framed for war or conquest; for it would thenhave no occasion for these. It is evident therefore that the business ofwar is to be considered as commendable, not as a final end, but as themeans of procuring it. It is the duty of a good legislator to examinecarefully into his state; and the nature of the people, and how they maypartake of every intercourse, of a good life, and of the happiness whichresults from it: and in this respect some laws and customs differ fromothers. It is also the duty of a legislator, if he has any neighbouringstates to consider in what manner he shall oppose each of them, or whatgood offices he shall show them. But what should be the final end of thebest governments will be considered hereafter.IIWe will now speak to those who, while they agree that a life of virtueis most eligible, yet differ in the use of it addressing ourselves toboth these parties; for there are some who disapprove of all politicalgovernments, and think that the life of one who is really free isdifferent from the life of a citizen, and of all others most eligible:others again think that the citizen is the best; and that it isimpossible for him who does nothing to be well employed; but thatvirtuous activity and happiness are the same thing. Now both parties insome particulars say what is right, in others what is wrong, thus, thatthe life of a freeman is better than the life of a slave is true, fora slave, as a slave, is employed in nothing honourable; for the commonservile employments which he is commanded to perform have nothingvirtuous in them; but, on the other hand, it is not true that asubmission to all sorts of governments is slavery; for the government offreemen differs not more from the government of slaves than slavery andfreedom differ from each other in their nature; and how they do has beenalready mentioned. To prefer doing of nothing to virtuous activity isalso wrong, for happiness consists in action, and many noble ends areproduced by the actions of the just and wise. From what we have alreadydetermined on this subject, some one probably may think, that supremepower is of all things best, as that will enable a man to command verymany useful services from others; so that he who can obtain this oughtnot to give it up to another, but rather to seize it: and, for thispurpose, the father should have no attention or regard for the son, orthe son for the father, or friend for friend; for what is best is mosteligible: but to be a member of the community and be in felicity isbest. What these persons advance might probably be true, if the supremegood was certainly theirs who plunder and use violence to others: butit is [1325b] most unlikely that it should be so; for it is a meresupposition: for it does not follow that their actions are honourablewho thus assume the supreme power over others, without they were bynature as superior to them as a man to a woman, a father to a child, amaster to a slave: so that he who so far forsakes the paths of virtuecan never return back from whence he departed from them: for amongstequals whatever is fair and just ought to be reciprocal; for this isequal and right; but that equals should not partake of what is equal, orlike to like, is contrary to nature: but whatever is contrary to natureis not right; therefore, if there is any one superior to the rest of thecommunity in virtue and abilities for active life, him it is proper tofollow, him it is right to obey, but the one alone will not do, but mustbe joined to the other also: and, if we are right in what we have nowsaid, it follows that happiness consists in virtuous activity, and thatboth with respect to the community as well as the individual an activelife is the happiest: not that an active life must necessarily refer toother persons, as some think, or that those studies alone are practicalwhich are pursued to teach others what to do; for those are much moreso whose final object is in themselves, and to improve the judgment andunderstanding of the man; for virtuous activity has an end, thereforeis something practical; nay, those who contrive the plan which othersfollow are more particularly said to act, and are superior to theworkmen who execute their designs. But it is not necessary that stateswhich choose to have no intercourse with others should remain inactive;for the several members thereof may have mutual intercourse with eachother; for there are many opportunities for this among the differentcitizens; the same thing is true of every individual: for, was itotherwise, neither could the Deity nor the universe be perfect; toneither of whom can anything external separately exist. Hence it isevident that that very same life which is happy for each individual ishappy also for the state and every member of it.VAs I have now finished what was introductory to this subject, andconsidered at large the nature of other states, it now remains that Ishould first say what ought to be the establishment of a city which oneshould form according to one's wish; for no good state can exist withouta moderate proportion of what is necessary. Many things thereforeought to be forethought of as desirable, but none of them such as areimpossible: I mean relative to the number of citizens and the extentof the territory: for as other artificers, such as the weaver and theshipwright, ought to have such materials as are fit for their work,since so much the better they are, by so much [1326a] superior will thework itself necessarily be; so also ought the legislator and politicianendeavour to procure proper materials for the business they have inhand. Now the first and principal instrument of the politician is thenumber of the people; he should therefore know how many, and what theynaturally ought to be: in like manner the country, how large, and whatit is. Most persons think that it is necessary for a city to be large tobe happy: but, should this be true, they cannot tell what is a large oneand what a small one; for according to the multitude of the inhabitantsthey estimate the greatness of it; but they ought rather to consider itsstrength than its numbers; for a state has a certain object in view, andfrom the power which it has in itself of accomplishing it, its greatnessought to be estimated; as a person might say, that Hippocrates was agreater physician, though not a greater man, than one that exceeded himin the size of his body: but if it was proper to determine the strengthof the city from the number of the inhabitants, it should never becollected from the multitude in general who may happen to be in it;for in a city there must necessarily be many slaves, sojourners, andforeigners; but from those who are really part of the city and properlyconstitute its members; a multitude of these is indeed a proof of alarge city, but in a state where a large number of mechanics inhabit,and but few soldiers, such a state cannot be great; for the greatness ofthe city, and the number of men in it, are not the same thing. This toois evident from fact, that it is very difficult, if not impossible, togovern properly a very numerous body of men; for of all the states whichappear well governed we find not one where the rights of a citizen areopen to an indiscriminate multitude. And this is also evident from thenature of the thing; for as law is a certain order, so good law is ofcourse a certain good order: but too large a multitude are incapable ofthis, unless under the government of that DIVINE POWER which comprehendsthe universe. Not but that, as quantity and variety are usuallyessential to beauty, the perfection of a city consists in the largenessof it as far as that largeness is consistent with that order alreadymentioned: but still there is a determinate size to all cities, as wellas everything else, whether animals, plants, or machines, for each ofthese, if they are neither too little nor too big, have theirproper powers; but when they have not their due growth, or are badlyconstructed, as a ship a span long is not properly a ship, nor one oftwo furlongs length, but when it is of a fit size; for either from itssmallness or from its largeness it may be quite useless: so is it witha city; one that is too small has not [1326b] in itself the power ofself-defence, but this is essential to a city: one that is too large iscapable of self-defence in what is necessary; but then it is a nationand not a city: for it will be very difficult to accommodate a formof government to it: for who would choose to be the general of suchan unwieldy multitude, or who could be their herald but a stentor? Thefirst thing therefore necessary is, that a city should consist of suchnumbers as will be sufficient to enable the inhabitants to livehappily in their political community: and it follows, that the more theinhabitants exceed that necessary number the greater will the city be:but this must not be, as we have already said, without bounds; but whatis its proper limit experience will easily show, and this experience isto be collected from the actions both of the governors and the governed.Now, as it belongs to the first to direct the inferior magistrates andto act as judges, it follows that they can neither determine causeswith justice nor issue their orders with propriety without they know thecharacters of their fellow-citizens: so that whenever this happens notto be done in these two particulars, the state must of necessity bebadly managed; for in both of them it is not right to determine toohastily and without proper knowledge, which must evidently be the casewhere the number of the citizens is too many: besides, it is more easyfor strangers and sojourners to assume the rights of citizens, as theywill easily escape detection in so great a multitude. It is evident,then, that the best boundary for a city is that wherein the numbers arethe greatest possible, that they may be the better able to be sufficientin themselves, while at the same time they are not too large to be underthe eye and government of the magistrates. And thus let us determine theextent of a city.CHAPTER VWhat we have said concerning a city may nearly be applied to a country;for as to what soil it should be, every one evidently will commend itif it is such as is sufficient in itself to furnish what will make theinhabitants happy; for which purpose it must be able to supply themwith all the necessaries of life; for it is the having these in plenty,without any want, which makes them content. As to its extent, it shouldbe such as may enable the inhabitants to live at their ease with freedomand temperance. Whether we have done right or wrong in fixing this limitto the territory shall be considered more minutely hereafter, whenwe come particularly to inquire into property, and what fortune isrequisite for a man to live on, and how and in what manner they oughtto employ it; for there are many doubts upon this question, while eachparty insists upon their own plan of life being carried to an excess,the one of severity, the other of indulgence. What the situation of thecountry should be it is not difficult to determine, in some particularsrespecting that we ought to be advised by those who are skilful inmilitary affairs. It should be difficult of access to an enemy, buteasy to the inhabitants: and as we said, that the number of [1327a]inhabitants ought to be such as can come under the eye of themagistrate, so should it be with the country; for then it is easilydefended. As to the position of the city, if one could place it to one'swish, it is convenient to fix it on the seaside: with respect tothe country, one situation which it ought to have has been alreadymentioned, namely, that it should be so placed as easily to giveassistance to all places, and also to receive the necessaries of lifefrom all parts, and also wood, or any other materials which may happento be in the country.CHAPTER VIBut with respect to placing a city in the neighbourhood of the sea,there are some who have many doubts whether it is serviceable or hurtfulto a well-regulated state; for they say, that the resort of personsbrought up under a different system of government is disserviceableto the state, as well by impeding the laws as by their numbers; for amultitude of merchants must necessarily arise from their traffickingbackward and forward upon the seas, which will hinder the well-governingof the city: but if this inconvenience should not arise, it is evidentthat it is better, both on account of safety and also for the easieracquisition of the necessaries of life, that both the city and thecountry should be near the sea; for it is necessary that those who areto sustain the attack of the enemy should be ready with their assistanceboth by land and by sea, and to oppose any inroad, both ways if possiblebut if not, at least where they are most powerful, which they maydo while they possess both. A maritime situation is also useful forreceiving from others what your own country will not produce, andexporting those necessaries of your own growth which are more than youhave occasion for; but a city ought to traffic to supply its own wants,and not the wants of others; for those who themselves furnish an openmarket for every one, do it for the sake of gain; which it is not properfor a well-established state to do, neither should they encourage sucha commerce. Now, as we see that many places and cities have docks andharbours lying very convenient for the city, while those who frequentthem have no communication with the citadel, and yet they are not toofar off, but are surrounded by walls and such-like fortifications, it isevident, that if any good arises from such an intercourse the city willreceive it, but if anything hurtful, it will be easy to restrain it bya law declaring and deputing whom the state will allow to have anintercourse with each other, and whom not. As to a naval power, it is byno means doubtful that it is necessary to have one to a certain degree;and this not only for the sake of the [1327b] city itself, but alsobecause it may be necessary to appear formidable to some of theneighbouring states, or to be able to assist them as well by sea asby land; but to know how great that force should be, the health of thestate should be inquired into, and if that appears vigorous and enablesher to take the lead of other communities, it is necessary that herforce should correspond with her actions. As for that multitude ofpeople which a maritime power creates, they are by no means necessary toa state, nor ought they to make a part of the citizens; for the marinersand infantry, who have the command, are freemen, and upon these dependsa naval engagement: but when there are many servants and husbandmen,there they will always have a number of sailors, as we now see happensto some states, as in Heraclea, where they man many triremes, thoughthe extent of their city is much inferior to some others. And thus wedetermine concerning the country, the port, the city, the sea, and amaritime power: as to the number of the citizens, what that ought to bewe have already said.CHAPTER VIIWe now proceed to point out what natural disposition the members of thecommunity ought to be of: but this any one will easily perceive whowill cast his eye over the states of Greece, of all others the mostcelebrated, and also the other different nations of this habitableworld. Those who live in cold countries, as the north of Europe, arefull of courage, but wanting in understanding and the arts: thereforethey are very tenacious of their liberty; but, not being politicians,they cannot reduce their neighbours under their power: but the Asiatics,whose understandings are quick, and who are conversant in the arts, aredeficient in courage; and therefore are always conquered and theslaves of others: but the Grecians, placed as it were between thesetwo boundaries, so partake of them both as to be at the same time bothcourageous and sensible; for which reason Greece continues free, andgoverned in the best manner possible, and capable of commanding thewhole world, could they agree upon one system of policy. Now this is thedifference between the Grecians and other nations, that the latter havebut one of these qualities, whereas in the former they are both happilyblended together. Hence it is evident, that those persons ought to beboth sensible and courageous who will readily obey a legislator, theobject of whose laws is virtue. As to what some persons say, that themilitary must be mild and tender to those they know, but severe andcruel to those they know not, it is courage which [1328a] makes any onelovely; for that is the faculty of the soul which we most admire: asa proof of this, our resentment rises higher against our friends andacquaintance than against those we know not: for which reason Archilausaccusing his friends says very properly to himself, Shall my friendsinsult me? The spirit of freedom and command also is what all inheritwho are of this disposition for courage is commanding and invincible. Italso is not right for any one to say, that you should be severe to thoseyou know not; for this behaviour is proper for no one: nor are those whoare of a noble disposition harsh in their manners, excepting only to thewicked; and when they are particularly so, it is, as has been alreadysaid, against their friends, when they think they have injured them;which is agreeable to reason: for when those who think they ought toreceive a favour from any one do not receive it, beside the injury donethem, they consider what they are deprived of: hence the saying, \"Cruelare the wars of brothers;\" and this, \"Those who have greatly loveddo greatly hate.\" And thus we have nearly determined how many theinhabitants of a city ought to be, and what their natural disposition,and also the country how large, and of what sort is necessary; I saynearly, because it is needless to endeavour at as great accuracy inthose things which are the objects of the senses as in those which areinquired into by the understanding only.CHAPTER VIIIAs in natural bodies those things are not admitted to be parts of themwithout which the whole would not exist, so also it is evident that ina political state everything that is necessary thereunto is not to beconsidered as a part of it, nor any other community from whence onewhole is made; for one thing ought to be common and the same to thecommunity, whether they partake of it equally or unequally, as, forinstance, food, land, or the like; but when one thing is for the benefitof one person, and another for the benefit of another, in this there isnothing like a community, excepting that one makes it and the otheruses it; as, for instance, between any instrument employed in making anywork, and the workmen, as there is nothing common between the house andthe builder, but the art of the builder is employed on the house. Thusproperty is necessary for states, but property is no part of the state,though many species of it have life; but a city is a community ofequals, for the purpose of enjoying the best life possible: but thehappiest life is the best which consists in the perfect practice ofvirtuous energies: as therefore some persons have great, others littleor no opportunity of being employed in these, it is evident that thisis the cause of the difference there is between the different cities andcommunities there are to be found; for while each of these endeavour toacquire what is best by various and different means, they give [1328b]rise to different modes of living and different forms of government. Weare now to consider what those things are without which a city cannotpossibly exist; for what we call parts of the city must of necessityinhere in it: and this we shall plainly understand, if we know thenumber of things necessary to a city: first, the inhabitants musthave food: secondly, arts, for many instruments are necessary in life:thirdly, arms, for it is necessary that the community should have anarmed force within themselves, both to support their government againstthose of their own body who might refuse obedience to it, and alsoto defend it from those who might attempt to attack it from without:fourthly, a certain revenue, as well for the internal necessities ofthe state as for the business of war: fifthly, which is indeed the chiefconcern, a religious establishment: sixthly in order, but first of allin necessity, a court to determine both criminal and civil causes. Thesethings are absolutely necessary, so to speak, in every state; for a cityis a number of people not accidentally met together, but with a purposeof ensuring to themselves sufficient independency and self-protection;and if anything necessary for these purposes is wanting, it isimpossible that in such a situation these ends can be obtained. It isnecessary therefore that a city should be capable of acquiring all thesethings: for this purpose a proper number of husbandmen are necessary toprocure food, also artificers and soldiers, and rich men, and priestsand judges, to determine what is right and proper.XHaving determined thus far, it remains that we consider whether allthese different employments shall be open to all; for it is possibleto continue the same persons always husbandmen, artificers, judges,or counsellors; or shall we appoint different persons to each of thoseemployments which we have already mentioned; or shall some of them beappropriated to particulars, and others of course common to all? butthis does not take place in every state, for, as we have already said,it is possible that all may be common to all, or not, but only common tosome; and this is the difference between one government and another:for in democracies the whole community partakes of everything, but inoligarchies it is different.Since we are inquiring what is the best government possible, and it isadmitted to be that in which the citizens are happy; and that, as wehave already said, it is impossible to obtain happiness without virtue;it follows, that in the best-governed states, where the citizens arereally men of intrinsic and not relative goodness, none of them shouldbe permitted to exercise any mechanic employment or follow merchandise,as being ignoble and destructive to virtue; neither should they behusband-[1329a] men, that they may be at leisure to improve in virtueand perform the duty they owe to the state. With respect to theemployments of a soldier, a senator, and a judge, which are evidentlynecessary to the community, shall they be allotted to different persons,or shall the same person execute both? This question, too, is easilyanswered: for in some cases the same persons may execute them, inothers they should be different, where the different employments requiredifferent abilities, as when courage is wanting for one, judgment forthe other, there they should be allotted to different persons; but whenit is evident, that it is impossible to oblige those who have armsin their hands, and can insist on their own terms, to be always undercommand; there these different employments should be trusted to oneperson; for those who have arms in their hands have it in their optionwhether they will or will not assume the supreme power: to these two(namely, those who have courage and judgment) the government must beentrusted; but not in the same manner, but as nature directs; whatrequires courage to the young, what requires judgment to the old; forwith the young is courage, with the old is wisdom: thus each will beallotted the part they are fit for according to their different merits.It is also necessary that the landed property should belong to thesemen; for it is necessary that the citizens should be rich, and these arethe men proper for citizens; for no mechanic ought to be admitted to therights of a citizen, nor any other sort of people whose employment isnot entirely noble, honourable, and virtuous; this is evident from theprinciple we at first set out with; for to be happy it is necessaryto be virtuous; and no one should say that a city is happy while heconsiders only one part of its citizens, but for that purpose he oughtto examine into all of them. It is evident, therefore, that the landedproperty should belong to these, though it may be necessary for them tohave husbandmen, either slaves, barbarians, or servants. There remainsof the different classes of the people whom we have enumerated, thepriests, for these evidently compose a rank by themselves; for neitherare they to be reckoned amongst the husbandmen nor the mechanics; forreverence to the gods is highly becoming every state: and since thecitizens have been divided into orders, the military and the council,and it is proper to offer due worship to the gods, and since it isnecessary that those who are employed in their service should havenothing else to do, let the business of the priesthood be allottedto those who are in years. We have now shown what is necessary to theexistence of a city, and of what parts it consists, and that husbandmen,mechanic, and mercenary servants are necessary to a city; but thatthe parts of it are soldiers and sailors, and that these are alwaysdifferent from those, but from each other only occasionally.CHAPTER XIt seems neither now nor very lately to have been known [1329b] to thosephilosophers who have made politics their study, that a city ought tobe divided by families into different orders of men; and that thehusbandmen and soldiers should be kept separate from each other;which custom is even to this day preserved in Egypt and in Crete; alsoSesostris having founded it in Egypt, Minos in Crete. Common meals seemalso to have been an ancient regulation, and to have been establishedin Crete during the reign of Minos, and in a still more remote periodin Italy; for those who are the best judges in that country say thatone Italus being king of AEnotria., from whom the people, changing theirnames, were called Italians instead of AEnotrians, and that part ofEurope was called Italy which is bounded by the Scylletic Gulf on theone side and the Lametic on the other, the distance between whichis about half a day's journey. This Italus, they relate, made theAEnotrians, who were formerly shepherds, husbandmen, and gave themdifferent laws from what they had before, and to have been the first whoestablished common meals, for which reason some of his descendants stilluse them, and observe some of his laws. The Opici inhabit that partwhich lies towards the Tyrrhenian Sea, who both now are and formerlywere called Ausonians. The Chones inhabited the part toward Iapigia andthe Ionian Sea which is called Syrtis. These Chones were descendedfrom the AEnotrians. Hence arose the custom of common meals, but theseparation of the citizens into different families from Egypt: for thereign of Sesostris is of much higher antiquity than that of Minos. Aswe ought to think that most other things were found out in a long, nay,even in a boundless time (reason teaching us that want would make usfirst invent that which was necessary, and, when that was obtained, thenthose things which were requisite for the conveniences and ornament oflife), so should we conclude the same with respect to a political state;now everything in Egypt bears the marks of the most remote antiquity,for these people seem to be the most ancient of all others, and to haveacquired laws and political order; we should therefore make a properuse of what is told us of them, and endeavour to find out what they haveomitted. We have already said, that the landed property ought to belongto the military and those who partake of the government of the state;and that therefore the husbandmen should be a separate order of people;and how large and of what nature the country ought to be: we will firsttreat of the division of the land, and of the husbandmen, how many andof what sort they ought to be; since we by no means hold that propertyought to be common, as some persons have said, only thus far, infriendship, it [1330a] should be their custom to let no citizen wantsubsistence. As to common meals, it is in general agreed that they areproper in well-regulated cities; my reasons for approving of them shallbe mentioned hereafter: they are what all the citizens ought to partakeof; but it will not be easy for the poor, out of what is their own, tofurnish as much as they are ordered to do, and supply their own housebesides. The expense also of religious worship should be defrayed by thewhole state. Of necessity therefore the land ought to be divided intotwo parts, one of which should belong to the community in general, theother to the individuals separately; and each of these parts shouldagain be subdivided into two: half of that which belongs to the publicshould be appropriated to maintain the worship of the gods, the otherhalf to support the common meals. Half of that which belongs to theindividuals should be at the extremity of the country, the other halfnear the city, so that these two portions being allotted to each person,all would partake of land in both places, which would be both equal andright; and induce them to act in concert with greater harmony in any warwith their neighbours: for when the land is not divided in this manner,one party neglects the inroads of the enemy on the borders, the othermakes it a matter of too much consequence and more than is necessary;for which reason in some places there is a law which forbids theinhabitants of the borders to have any vote in the council when they aredebating upon a war which is made against them as their private interestmight prevent their voting impartially. Thus therefore the country oughtto be divided and for the reasons before mentioned. Could one have one'schoice, the husbandmen should by all means be slaves, not of the samenation, or men of any spirit; for thus they would be laborious intheir business, and safe from attempting any novelties: next to thesebarbarian servants are to be preferred, similar in natural dispositionto these we have already mentioned. Of these, let those who areto cultivate the private property of the individual belong to thatindividual, and those who are to cultivate the public territory belongto the public. In what manner these slaves ought to be used, and forwhat reason it is very proper that they should have the promise of theirliberty made them, as a reward for their services, shall be mentionedhereafter.CHAPTER XIWe have already mentioned, that both the city and all the country shouldcommunicate both with the sea and the continent as much as possible.There are these four things which we should be particularly desirous ofin the position of the city with respect to itself: in the first place,health is to be consulted as the first thing necessary: now a citywhich fronts the east and receives the winds which blow from thence isesteemed most healthful; next to this that which has a northern positionis to be preferred, as best in winter. It should next be contrived thatit may have a proper situation for the business of government and fordefence in war: that in war the citizens may [1330b] have easy accessto it; but that it may be difficult of access to, and hardly to be takenby, the enemy. In the next place particularly, that there may be plentyof water, and rivers near at hand: but if those cannot be found, verylarge cisterns must be prepared to save rain-water, so that there maybe no want of it in case they should be driven into the town in time ofwar. And as great care should be taken of the health of the inhabitants,the first thing to be attended to is, that the city should have a goodsituation and a good position; the second is, that they may have goodwater to drink; and this not be negligently taken care of; for whatwe chiefly and most frequently use for the support of the body mustprincipally influence the health of it; and this influence is what theair and water naturally have: for which reason in all wise governmentsthe waters ought to be appropriated to different purposes, and if theyare not equally good, and if there is not a plenty of necessary water,that which is to drink should be separated from that which is for otheruses. As to fortified places, what is proper for some governments isnot proper for all; as, for instance, a lofty citadel is proper for amonarchy and an oligarchy; a city built upon a plain suits a democracy;neither of these for an aristocracy, but rather many strong places. Asto the form of private houses, those are thought to be best and mostuseful for their different purposes which are distinct and separatefrom each other, and built in the modern manner, after the plan ofHippodamus: but for safety in time of war, on the contrary, they shouldbe built as they formerly were; for they were such that strangers couldnot easily find their way out of them, and the method of access tothem such as an enemy could with difficulty find out if he proposedto besiege them. A city therefore should have both these sorts ofbuildings, which may easily be contrived if any one will so regulatethem as the planters do their rows of vines; not that the buildingsthroughout the city should be detached from each other, only in someparts of it; thus elegance and safety will be equally consulted. Withrespect to walls, those who say that a courageous people ought not tohave any, pay too much respect to obsolete notions; particularly aswe may see those who pride themselves therein continually confuted byfacts. It is indeed disreputable for those who are equal, or nearly so,to the enemy, to endeavour to take refuge within their walls--but sinceit very often happens, that those who make the attack are too powerfulfor the bravery and courage of those few who oppose them to resist,if you would not suffer the calamities of war and the insolence of theenemy, it must be thought the part of a good soldier to seek for safetyunder the shelter and protection of walls more especially since so manymissile weapons and machines have been most ingeniously invented tobesiege cities with. Indeed to neglect surrounding a city with a wallwould be similar to choosing a country which is easy of access to anenemy, or levelling the eminences of it; or as if an individual shouldnot have a wall to his house lest it should be thought that the ownerof it was a coward: nor should this be left unconsidered, that those whohave a city surrounded with walls may act both ways, either as if it hador as if it had not; but where it has not they cannot do this. If thisis true, it is not only necessary to have walls, but care must be takenthat they may be a proper ornament to the city, as well as a defencein time of war; not only according to the old methods, but the modernimprovements also: for as those who make offensive war endeavour byevery way possible to gain advantages over their adversaries, so shouldthose who are upon the defensive employ all the means already known, andsuch new ones as philosophy can invent, to defend themselves: for thosewho are well prepared are seldom first attacked.CHAPTER XIIAs the citizens in general are to eat at public tables in certaincompanies, and it is necessary that the walls should have bulwarks andtowers in proper places and at proper distances, it is evident thatit will be very necessary to have some of these in the towers; let thebuildings for this purpose be made the ornaments of the walls. As totemples for public worship, and the hall for the public tables ofthe chief magistrates, they ought to be built in proper places, andcontiguous to each other, except those temples which the law or theoracle orders to be separate from all other buildings; and let these bein such a conspicuous eminence, that they may have every advantage ofsituation, and in the neighbourhood of that part of the city whichis best fortified. Adjoining to this place there ought to be a largesquare, like that which they call in Thessaly The Square of Freedom, inwhich nothing is permitted to be bought or sold; into which no mechanicnor husbandman, nor any such person, should be permitted to enter,unless commanded by the magistrates. It will also be an ornament to thisplace if the gymnastic exercises of the elders are performed in it. Itis also proper, that for performing these exercises the citizens shouldbe divided into distinct classes, according to their ages, and that theyoung persons should have proper officers to be with them, and that theseniors should be with the magistrates; for having them before theireyes would greatly inspire true modesty and ingenuous fear. There oughtto be another square [1331b] separate from this for buying and selling,which should be so situated as to be commodious for the receptionof goods both by sea and land. As the citizens may be divided intomagistrates and priests, it is proper that the public tables ofthe priests should be in buildings near the temples. Those of themagistrates who preside over contracts, indictments, and such-like, andalso over the markets, and the public streets near the square, or somepublic way, I mean the square where things are bought and sold; for Iintended the other for those who are at leisure, and this for necessarybusiness. The same order which I have directed here should be observedalso in the country; for there also their magistrates such as thesurveyors of the woods and overseers of the grounds, must necessarilyhave their common tables and their towers, for the purpose of protectionagainst an enemy. There ought also to be temples erected at properplaces, both to the gods and the heroes; but it is unnecessary to dwelllonger and most minutely on these particulars--for it is by no meansdifficult to plan these things, it is rather so to carry them intoexecution; for the theory is the child of our wishes, but the practicalpart must depend upon fortune; for which reason we shall decline sayinganything farther upon these subjects.CHAPTER XIIIWe will now show of what numbers and of what sort of people a governmentought to consist, that the state may be happy and well administered.As there are two particulars on which the excellence and perfection ofeverything depend, one of these is, that the object and end proposedshould be proper; the other, that the means to accomplish it should beadapted to that purpose; for it may happen that these may either agreeor disagree with each other; for the end we propose may be good, but intaking the means to obtain it we may err; at other times we may havethe right and proper means in our power, but the end may be bad,and sometimes we may mistake in both; as in the art of medicine thephysician does not sometimes know in what situation the body ought tobe, to be healthy; nor what to do to procure the end he aims at. Inevery art and science, therefore, we should be master of this knowledge,namely, the proper end, and the means to obtain it. Now it is evidentthat all persons are desirous to live well and be happy; but that somehave the means thereof in their own power, others not; and this eitherthrough nature [1332a] or fortune; for many ingredients are necessary toa happy life; but fewer to those who are of a good than to those who areof a bad disposition. There are others who continually have the meansof happiness in their own power, but do not rightly apply them. Sincewe propose to inquire what government is best, namely, that by whicha state may be best administered, and that state is best administeredwhere the people are the happiest, it is evident that happiness is athing we should not be unacquainted with. Now, I have already said inmy treatise on Morals (if I may here make any use of what I have thereshown), that happiness consists in the energy and perfect practice ofvirtue; and this not relatively, but simply; I mean by relatively, whatis necessary in some certain circumstances; by simply, what is good andfair in itself: of the first sort are just punishments, and restraintsin a just cause; for they arise from virtue and are necessary, and onthat account are virtuous; though it is more desirable that neither anystate nor any individual should stand in need of them; but those actionswhich are intended either to procure honour or wealth are simply good;the others eligible only to remove an evil; these, on the contrary, arethe foundation and means of relative good. A worthy man indeed will bearpoverty, disease, and other unfortunate accidents with a noble mind;but happiness consists in the contrary to these (now we have alreadydetermined in our treatise on Morals, that he is a man of worth whoconsiders what is good because it is virtuous as what is simply good; itis evident, therefore, that all the actions of such a one must be worthyand simply good): this has led some persons to conclude, that the causeof happiness was external goods; which would be as if any one shouldsuppose that the playing well upon the lyre was owing to the instrument,and not to the art. It necessarily follows from what has been said,that some things should be ready at hand and others procured by thelegislator; for which reason in founding a city we earnestly wish thatthere may be plenty of those things which are supposed to be under thedominion of fortune (for some things we admit her to be mistress over);but for a state to be worthy and great is not only the work of fortunebut of knowledge and judgment also. But for a state to be worthy it isnecessary that those citizens which are in the administration shouldbe worthy also; but as in our city every citizen is to be so, we mustconsider how this may be accomplished; for if this is what every onecould be, and not some individuals only, it would be more desirable; forthen it would follow, that what might be done by one might be doneby all. Men are worthy and good three ways; by nature, by custom, byreason. In the first place, a man ought to be born a man, and not anyother animal; that is to say, he ought to have both a body and soul; butit avails not to be only born [1332b] with some things, for custommakes great alterations; for there are some things in nature capable ofalteration either way which are fixed by custom, either for the betteror the worse. Now, other animals live chiefly a life of nature; and invery few things according to custom; but man lives according to reasonalso, which he alone is endowed with; wherefore he ought to make allthese accord with each other; for if men followed reason, and werepersuaded that it was best to obey her, they would act in many respectscontrary to nature and custom. What men ought naturally to be, to makegood members of a community, I have already determined; the rest ofthis discourse therefore shall be upon education; for some things areacquired by habit, others by hearing them.CHAPTER XIVAs every political community consists of those who govern and of thosewho are governed, let us consider whether during the continuance oftheir lives they ought to be the same persons or different; for itis evident that the mode of education should be adapted to thisdistinction. Now, if one man differed from another as much, as webelieve, the gods and heroes differ from men: in the first place, beingfar their superiors in body; and, secondly, in the soul: so that thesuperiority of the governors over the governed might be evident beyonda doubt, it is certain that it would be better for the one always togovern, the other always to be governed: but, as this is not easy toobtain, and kings are not so superior to those they govern as Scylaxinforms us they are in India, it is evident that for many reasons it isnecessary that all in their turns should both govern and be governed:for it is just that those who are equal should have everything alike;and it is difficult for a state to continue which is founded ininjustice; for all those in the country who are desirous of innovationwill apply themselves to those who are under the government of the rest,and such will be their numbers in the state, that it will be impossiblefor the magistrates to get the better of them. But that the governorsought to excel the governed is beyond a doubt; the legislator thereforeought to consider how this shall be, and how it may be contrived thatall shall have their equal share in the administration. Now, withrespect to this it will be first said, that nature herself has directedus in our choice, laying down the selfsame thing when she has made someyoung, others old: the first of whom it becomes to obey, the latterto command; for no one when he is young is offended at his being undergovernment, or thinks himself too good for it; more especially when heconsiders that he himself shall receive the same honours which hepays when he shall arrive at a proper age. In some respects it must beacknowledged that the governors and the governed are the same, in othersthey are different; it is therefore necessary that their educationshould be in [1333a] some respect the same, in others different: as theysay, that he will be a good governor who has first learnt to obey. Nowof governments, as we have already said, some are instituted for thesake of him who commands; others for him who obeys: of the first sort isthat of the master over the servant; of the latter, that of freemen overeach other. Now some things which are commanded differ from others; notin the business, but in the end proposed thereby: for which reason manyworks, even of a servile nature, are not disgraceful for young freemento perform; for many things which are ordered to be done are nothonourable or dishonourable so much in their own nature as in the endwhich is proposed, and the reason for which they are undertaken. Sincethen we have determined, that the virtue of a good citizen and goodgovernor is the same as of a good man; and that every one before hecommands should have first obeyed, it is the business of the legislatorto consider how his citizens may be good men, what education isnecessary to that purpose, and what is the final object of a good life.The soul of man may be divided into two parts; that which has reason initself, and that which hath not, but is capable of obeying its dictates:and according to the virtues of these two parts a man is said to begood: but of those virtues which are the ends, it will not be difficultfor those to determine who adopt the division I have already given; forthe inferior is always for the sake of the superior; and this is equallyevident both in the works of art as well as in those of nature; but thatis superior which has reason. Reason itself also is divided intotwo parts, in the manner we usually divide it; the theoretic and thepractical; which division therefore seems necessary for this part also:the same analogy holds good with respect to actions; of which thosewhich are of a superior nature ought always to be chosen by those whohave it in their power; for that is always most eligible to every onewhich will procure the best ends. Now life is divided into labour andrest, war and peace; and of what we do the objects are partly necessaryand useful, partly noble: and we should give the same preference tothese that we do to the different parts of the soul and its actions,as war to procure peace; labour, rest; and the useful, the noble. Thepolitician, therefore, who composes a body of laws ought to extend hisviews to everything; the different parts of the soul and their actions;more particularly to those things which are of a superior nature andends; and, in the same manner, to the lives of men and their differentactions.They ought to be fitted both for labour and war, but rather [1333b] forrest and peace; and also to do what is necessary and useful, but ratherwhat is fair and noble. It is to those objects that the education of thechildren ought to tend, and of all the youths who want instruction. Allthe Grecian states which now seem best governed, and the legislators whofounded those states, appear not to have framed their polity with a viewto the best end, or to every virtue, in their laws and education; buteagerly to have attended to what is useful and productive of gain: andnearly of the same opinion with these are some persons who have writtenlately, who, by praising the Lacedaemonian state, show they approve ofthe intention of the legislator in making war and victory the end ofhis government. But how contrary to reason this is, is easily proved byargument, and has already been proved by facts (but as the generality ofmen desire to have an extensive command, that they may have everythingdesirable in the greater abundance; so Thibron and others who havewritten on that state seem to approve of their legislator for havingprocured them an extensive command by continually enuring them toall sorts of dangers and hardships): for it is evident, since theLacedemonians have now no hope that the supreme power will be in theirown hand, that neither are they happy nor was their legislator wise.This also is ridiculous, that while they preserved an obedience to theirlaws, and no one opposed their being governed by them, they lost themeans of being honourable: but these people understand not rightlywhat sort of government it is which ought to reflect honour on thelegislator; for a government of freemen is nobler than despotic power,and more consonant to virtue. Moreover, neither should a city be thoughthappy, nor should a legislator be commended, because he has so trainedthe people as to conquer their neighbours; for in this there is agreat inconvenience: since it is evident that upon this principle everycitizen who can will endeavour to procure the supreme power in his owncity; which crime the Lacedaemonians accuse Pausanias of, though heenjoyed such great honours.Such reasoning and such laws are neither political, useful nor true: buta legislator ought to instil those laws on the minds of men which aremost useful for them, both in their public and private capacities. Therendering a people fit for war, that they may enslave their inferiorsought not to be the care of the legislator; but that they may notthemselves be reduced to slavery by others. In [1334a] the next place,he should take care that the object of his government is the safetyof those who are under it, and not a despotism over all: in the thirdplace, that those only are slaves who are fit to be only so. Reasonindeed concurs with experience in showing that all the attention whichthe legislator pays to the business of war, and all other rules whichhe lays down, should have for their object rest and peace; since mostof those states (which we usually see) are preserved by war; but, afterthey have acquired a supreme power over those around them, are ruined;for during peace, like a sword, they lose their brightness: the fault ofwhich lies in the legislator, who never taught them how to be at rest.CHAPTER XVAs there is one end common to a man both as an individual and a citizen,it is evident that a good man and a good citizen must have the sameobject in view; it is evident that all the virtues which lead to restare necessary; for, as we have often said, the end of war is peace, oflabour, rest; but those virtues whose object is rest, and those alsowhose object is labour, are necessary for a liberal life and rest; forwe want a supply of many necessary things that we may be at rest. A citytherefore ought to be temperate, brave, and patient; for, according tothe proverb, \"Rest is not for slaves;\" but those who cannot bravely facedanger are the slaves of those who attack them. Bravery, therefore, andpatience are necessary for labour, philosophy for rest, and temperanceand justice in both; but these chiefly in time of peace and rest; forwar obliges men to be just and temperate; but the enjoyment of pleasure,with the rest of peace, is more apt to produce insolence; those indeedwho are easy in their circumstances, and enjoy everything that canmake them happy, have great occasion for the virtues of temperance andjustice. Thus if there are, as the poets tell us, any inhabitants inthe happy isles, to these a higher degree of philosophy, temperance, andjustice will be necessary, as they live at their ease in the full plentyof every sensual pleasure. It is evident, therefore, that these virtuesare necessary in every state that would be happy or worthy; for he whois worthless can never enjoy real good, much less is he qualified tobe at rest; but can appear good only by labour and being at war, butin peace and at rest the meanest of creatures. For which reason virtueshould not be cultivated as the Lacedaemonians did; for they did notdiffer from others in their opinion concerning the supreme good, but in[1334b] imagining this good was to be procured by a particular virtue;but since there are greater goods than those of war, it is evidentthat the enjoyment of those which are valuable in themselves should bedesired, rather than those virtues which are useful in war; but how andby what means this is to be acquired is now to be considered. We havealready assigned three causes on which it will depend; nature, custom,and reason, arid shown what sort of men nature must produce for thispurpose; it remains then that we determine which we shall first begin byin education, reason or custom, for these ought always to preserve themost entire harmony with each other; for it may happen that reason mayerr from the end proposed, and be corrected by custom. In the firstplace, it is evident that in this as in other things, its beginningor production arises from some principle, and its end also arises fromanother principle, which is itself an end. Now, with us, reason andintelligence are the end of nature; our production, therefore, and ourmanners ought to be accommodated to both these. In the next place, asthe soul and the body are two distinct things, so also we see that thesoul is divided into two parts, the reasoning and not-reasoning, withtheir habits which are two in number, one belonging to each, namelyappetite and intelligence; and as the body is in production before thesoul, so is the not-reasoning part of the soul before the reasoning; andthis is evident; for anger, will and desire are to be seen in childrennearly as soon as they are born; but reason and intelligence spring upas they grow to maturity. The body, therefore, necessarily demands ourcare before the soul; next the appetites for the sake of the mind; thebody for the sake of the soul.CHAPTER XVIIf then the legislator ought to take care that the bodies of thechildren are as perfect as possible, his first attention ought to begiven to matrimony; at what time and in what situation it is proper thatthe citizens should engage in the nuptial contract. Now, with respectto this alliance, the legislator ought both to consider the parties andtheir time of life, that they may grow old at the same part of time, andthat their bodily powers may not be different; that is to say, the manbeing able to have children, but the woman too old to bear them; or, onthe contrary, the woman be young enough to produce children, but the mantoo old to be a father; for from such a situation discords and disputescontinually arise. In the next place, with respect to the succession ofchildren, there ought not to be too great an interval of time betweenthem and their parents; for when there is, the parent can receive nobenefit from his child's affection, or the child any advantage from hisfather's protection; [1335a] neither should the difference in years betoo little, as great inconveniences may arise from it; as it preventsthat proper reverence being shown to a father by a boy who considers himas nearly his equal in age, and also from the disputes it occasions inthe economy of the family. But, to return from this digression, careought to be taken that the bodies of the children may be such as willanswer the expectations of the legislator; this also will be affectedby the same means. Since season for the production of children isdetermined (not exactly, but to speak in general), namely, for the mantill seventy years, and the woman till fifty, the entering into themarriage state, as far as time is concerned, should be regulated bythese periods. It is extremely bad for the children when the fatheris too young; for in all animals whatsoever the parts of the young areimperfect, and are more likely to be productive of females than males,and diminutive also in size; the same thing of course necessarily holdstrue in men; as a proof of this you may see in those cities where themen and women usually marry very young, the people in general are verysmall and ill framed; in child-birth also the women suffer more, andmany of them die. And thus some persons tell us the oracle of Traezeniumshould be explained, as if it referred to the many women who weredestroyed by too early marriages, and not their gathering their fruitstoo soon. It is also conducive to temperance not to marry too soon; forwomen who do so are apt to be intemperate. It also prevents the bodiesof men from acquiring their full size if they marry before their growthis completed; for this is the determinate period, which prevents anyfurther increase; for which reason the proper time for a woman to marryis eighteen, for a man thirty-seven, a little more or less; for whenthey marry at that time their bodies are in perfection, and they willalso cease to have children at a proper time; and moreover with respectto the succession of the children, if they have them at the time whichmay reasonably be expected, they will be just arriving into perfectionwhen their parents are sinking down under the load of seventy years.And thus much for the time which is proper for marriage; but moreovera proper season of the year should be observed, as many persons do now,and appropriate the winter for this business. The married couple oughtalso to regard the precepts of physicians and naturalists, each of whomhave treated on these [1335b] subjects. What is the fit disposition ofthe body will be better mentioned when we come to speak of the educationof the child; we will just slightly mention a few particulars. Now,there is no occasion that any one should have the habit of body of awrestler to be either a good citizen, or to enjoy a good constitution,or to be the father of healthy children; neither should he be infirm ortoo much dispirited by misfortunes, but between both these. He ought tohave a habit of labour, but not of too violent labour; nor should thatbe confined to one object only, as the wrestler's is; but to such thingsas are proper for freemen. These things are equally necessary both formen and women. Women with child should also take care that their diet isnot too sparing, and that they use sufficient exercise; which it will beeasy for the legislator to effect if he commands them once every dayto repair to the worship of the gods who are supposed to preside overmatrimony. But, contrary to what is proper for the body, the mind oughtto be kept as tranquil as possible; for as plants partake of the natureof the soil, so does the child receive much of the disposition of themother. With respect to the exposing or bringing up of children, letit be a law, that nothing imperfect or maimed shall be broughtup,.......... As the proper time has been pointed out for a man and awoman to enter into the marriage state, so also let us determinehow long it is advantageous for the community that they should havechildren; for as the children of those who are too young are imperfectboth in body and mind, so also those whose parents are too old are weakin both: while therefore the body continues in perfection, which (assome poets say, who reckon the different periods of life by sevens)is till fifty years, or four or five more, the children may be equallyperfect; but when the parents are past that age it is better they shouldhave no more. With respect to any connection between a man and a woman,or a woman and a man, when either of the parties are betrothed, letit be held in utter detestation [1336a] on any pretext whatsoever;but should any one be guilty of such a thing after the marriage isconsummated, let his infamy be as great as his guilt deserves.CHAPTER XVIIWhen a child is born it must be supposed that the strength of its bodywill depend greatly upon the quality of its food. Now whoever willexamine into the nature of animals, and also observe those people whoare very desirous their children should acquire a warlike habit, willfind that they feed them chiefly with milk, as being best accommodatedto their bodies, but without wine, to prevent any distempers: thosemotions also which are natural to their age are very serviceable; andto prevent any of their limbs from being crooked, on account of theirextreme ductility, some people even now use particular machines thattheir bodies may not be distorted. It is also useful to enure them tothe cold when they are very little; for this is very serviceable fortheir health; and also to enure them to the business of war; for whichreason it is customary with many of the barbarians to dip their childrenin rivers when the water is cold; with others to clothe them veryslightly, as among the Celts; for whatever it is possible to accustomchildren to, it is best to accustom them to it at first, but to do itby degrees: besides, boys have naturally a habit of loving the cold, onaccount of the heat. These, then, and such-like things ought to be thefirst object of our attention: the next age to this continues tillthe child is five years old; during which time it is best to teach himnothing at all, not even necessary labour, lest it should hinder hisgrowth; but he should be accustomed to use so much motion as not toacquire a lazy habit of body; which he will get by various means and byplay also: his play also ought to be neither illiberal nor too laboriousnor lazy. Their governors and preceptors also should take care what sortof tales and stories it may be proper for them to hear; for all theseought to pave the way for their future instruction: for which reasonthe generality of their play should be imitations of what they areafterwards to do seriously. They too do wrong who forbid by lawsthe disputes between boys and their quarrels, for they contribute toincrease their growth--as they are a sort of exercise to the body:for the struggles of the heart and the compression of the spirits givestrength to those who labour, which happens to boys in their disputes.The preceptors also ought to have an eye upon their manner of life, andthose with whom they converse; and to take care that they are neverin the company of slaves. At this time and till they are seven [1336b]years old it is necessary that they should be educated at home. Itis also very proper to banish, both from their hearing and sight,everything which is illiberal and the like. Indeed it is as much thebusiness of the legislator as anything else, to banish every indecentexpression out of the state: for from a permission to speak whatever isshameful, very quickly arises the doing it, and this particularly withyoung people: for which reason let them never speak nor hear any suchthing: but if it appears that any freeman has done or said anything thatis forbidden before he is of age to be thought fit to partake of thecommon meals, let him be punished by disgrace and stripes; but if aperson above that age does so, let him be treated as you would aslave, on account of his being infamous. Since we forbid his speakingeverything which is forbidden, it is necessary that he neither seesobscene stories nor pictures; the magistrates therefore are to take carethat there are no statues or pictures of anything of this nature, exceptonly to those gods to whom the law permits them, and to which the lawallows persons of a certain age to pay their devotions, for themselves,their wives, and children. It should also be illegal for young personsto be present either at iambics or comedies before they are arrived atthat age when they are allowed to partake of the pleasures of the table:indeed a good education will preserve them from all the evils whichattend on these things. We have at present just touched upon thissubject; it will be our business hereafter, when we properly come toit, to determine whether this care of children is unnecessary, or,if necessary, in what manner it must be done; at present we have onlymentioned it as necessary. Probably the saying of Theodoras, the tragicactor, was not a bad one: That he would permit no one, not even themeanest actor, to go upon the stage before him, that he might firstengage the ear of the audience. The same thing happens both in ourconnections with men and things: what we meet with first pleases best;for which reason children should be kept strangers to everything whichis bad, more particularly whatsoever is loose and offensive to goodmanners. When five years are accomplished, the two next may be veryproperly employed in being spectators of those exercises they willafterwards have to learn. There are two periods into which educationought to be divided, according to the age of the child; the one is fromhis being seven years of age to the time of puberty; the other fromthence till he is one-and-twenty: for those who divide ages by thenumber seven [1337a] are in general wrong: it is much better to followthe division of nature; for every art and every instruction is intendedto complete what nature has left defective: we must first consider ifany regulation whatsoever is requisite for children; in the next place,if it is advantageous to make it a common care, or that every one shouldact therein as he pleases, which is the general practice in most cities;in the third place, what it ought to be.BOOK VIIINo one can doubt that the magistrate ought greatly to interest himselfin the care of youth; for where it is neglected it is hurtful to thecity, for every state ought to be governed according to its particularnature; for the form and manners of each government are peculiar toitself; and these, as they originally established it, so they usuallystill preserve it. For instance, democratic forms and manners ademocracy; oligarchic, an oligarchy: but, universally, the best mannersproduce the best government. Besides, as in every business and art thereare some things which men are to learn first and be made accustomed to,which are necessary to perform their several works; so it is evidentthat the same thing is necessary in the practice of virtue. As there isone end in view in every city, it is evident that education ought to beone and the same in each; and that this should be a common care, andnot the individual's, as it now is, when every one takes care of his ownchildren separately; and their instructions are particular also, eachperson teaching them as they please; but what ought to be engaged inought to be common to all. Besides, no one ought to think that anycitizen belongs to him in particular, but to the state in general; foreach one is a part of the state, and it is the natural duty of each partto regard the good of the whole: and for this the Lacedaemonians may bepraised; for they give the greatest attention to education, and makeit public. It is evident, then, that there should be laws concerningeducation, and that it should be public.IWhat education is, and how children ought to be instructed, is whatshould be well known; for there are doubts concerning the business ofit, as all people do not agree in those things they would have a childtaught, both with respect to their improvement in virtue and a happylife: nor is it clear whether the object of it should be to improvethe reason or rectify the morals. From the present mode of educationwe cannot determine with certainty to which men incline, whether toinstruct a child in what will be useful to him in life; or what tends tovirtue, and what is excellent: for all these things have their separatedefenders. As to virtue, there is no particular [1337b] in which theyall agree: for as all do not equally esteem all virtues, it reasonablyfollows that they will not cultivate the same. It is evident that whatis necessary ought to be taught to all: but that which is necessaryfor one is not necessary for all; for there ought to be a distinctionbetween the employment of a freeman and a slave. The first of theseshould be taught everything useful which will not make those who knowit mean. Every work is to be esteemed mean, and every art and everydiscipline which renders the body, the mind, or the understanding offreemen unfit for the habit and practice of virtue: for which reason allthose arts which tend to deform the body are called mean, and all thoseemployments which are exercised for gain; for they take off from thefreedom of the mind and render it sordid. There are also some liberalarts which are not improper for freemen to apply to in a certain degree;but to endeavour to acquire a perfect skill in them is exposed to thefaults I have just mentioned; for there is a great deal of differencein the reason for which any one does or learns anything: for it is notilliberal to engage in it for one's self, one's friend, or in the causeof virtue; while, at the same time, to do it for the sake of anothermay seem to be acting the part of a servant and a slave. The mode ofinstruction which now prevails seems to partake of both parts.IIThere are four things which it is usual to teach children--reading,gymnastic exercises, and music, to which (in the fourth place) some addpainting. Reading and painting are both of them of singular use in life,and gymnastic exercises, as productive of courage. As to music, somepersons may doubt, as most persons now use it for the sake of pleasure:but those who originally made it part of education did it because,as has been already said, nature requires that we should not only beproperly employed, but to be able to enjoy leisure honourably: for this(to repeat what I have already said) is of all things the principal.But, though both labour and rest are necessary, yet the latter ispreferable to the first; and by all means we ought to learn what weshould do when at rest: for we ought not to employ that time at play;for then play would be the necessary business of our lives. But if thiscannot be, play is more necessary for those who labour than those whoare at rest: for he who labours requires relaxation; which play willsupply: for as labour is attended with pain and continued exertion, itis necessary that play should be introduced, under proper regulations,as a medicine: for such an employment of the mind is a relaxation toit, and eases with pleasure. [1338a] Now rest itself seems to partake ofpleasure, of happiness, and an agreeable life: but this cannot be theirswho labour, but theirs who are at rest; for he who labours, labours forthe sake of some end which he has not: but happiness is an end whichall persons think is attended with pleasure and not with pain: but allpersons do not agree in making this pleasure consist in the same thing;for each one has his particular standard, correspondent to his ownhabits; but the best man proposes the best pleasure, and that whicharises from the noblest actions. But it is evident, that to live a lifeof rest there are some things which a man must learn and be instructedin; and that the object of this learning and this instruction centres intheir acquisition: but the learning and instruction which is given forlabour has for its object other things; for which reason the ancientsmade music a part of education; not as a thing necessary, for it is notof that nature, nor as a thing useful, as reading, in the common courseof life, or for managing of a family, or for learning anything as usefulin public life. Painting also seems useful to enable a man to judgemore accurately of the productions of the finer arts: nor is it likethe gymnastic exercises, which contribute to health and strength; forneither of these things do we see produced by music; there remains forit then to be the employment of our rest, which they had in view whointroduced it; and, thinking it a proper employment for freemen, to themthey allotted it; as Homer sings:   \"How right to call Thalia to the feast:\" and of some others he says:   \"The bard was call'd, to ravish every ear:\"and, in another place, he makes Ulysses say the happiest part of man'slife is   \"When at the festal board, in order plac'd, They hear the song.\"It is evident, then, that there is a certain education in which a childmay be instructed, not as useful nor as necessary, but as noble andliberal: but whether this is one or more than one, and of what sort theyare, and how to be taught, shall be considered hereafter: we are now gotso far on our way as to show that we have the testimony of the ancientsin our favour, by what they have delivered down upon education--formusic makes this plain. Moreover, it is necessary to instruct childrenin what is useful, not only on account of its being useful in itself,as, for instance, to learn to read, but also as the means of acquiringother different sorts of instruction: thus they should be instructedin painting, not only to prevent their being mistaken in purchasingpictures, or in buying or selling of vases, but rather as it makes[1338b] them judges of the beauties of the human form; for to be alwayshunting after the profitable ill agrees with great and freebornsouls. As it is evident whether a boy should be first taught morals orreasoning, and whether his body or his understanding should be firstcultivated, it is plain that boys should be first put under the care ofthe different masters of the gymnastic arts, both to form their bodiesand teach them their exercises.VNow those states which seem to take the greatest care of theirchildren's education, bestow their chief attention on wrestling, thoughit both prevents the increase of the body and hurts the form of it. Thisfault the Lacedaemonians did not fall into, for they made their childrenfierce by painful labour, as chiefly useful to inspire them withcourage: though, as we have already often said, this is neither theonly thing nor the principal thing necessary to attend to; and even withrespect to this they may not thus attain their end; for we do not findeither in other animals, or other nations, that courage necessarilyattends the most cruel, but rather the milder, and those who have thedispositions of lions: for there are many people who are eager bothto kill men and to devour human flesh, as the Achaeans and Heniochi inPontus, and many others in Asia, some of whom are as bad, others worsethan these, who indeed live by tyranny, but are men of no courage. Nay,we know that the Lacedaemonians themselves, while they continued thosepainful labours, and were superior to all others (though now they areinferior to many, both in war and gymnastic exercises), did not acquiretheir superiority by training their youth to these exercises,but because those who were disciplined opposed those who were notdisciplined at all. What is fair and honourable ought then to take placein education of what is fierce and cruel: for it is not a wolf, nor anyother wild beast, which will brave any noble danger, but rather a goodman. So that those who permit boys to engage too earnestly in theseexercises, while they do not take care to instruct them in what isnecessary to do, to speak the real truth, render them mean and vile,accomplished only in one duty of a citizen, and in every other respect,as reason evinces, good for nothing. Nor should we form our judgmentsfrom past events, but from what we see at present: for now they haverivals in their mode of education, whereas formerly they had not. Thatgymnastic exercises are useful, and in what manner, is admitted; forduring youth it is very proper to go through a course of those whichare most gentle, omitting that violent diet and those painful exerciseswhich are prescribed as necessary; that they may not prevent the growthof the body: and it is no small proof that they have this effect, thatamongst the Olympic candidates we can scarce find two or three who havegained a victory both when boys and men: because the necessary exercisesthey went through when young deprived them of their strength. When theyhave allotted three years from the time of puberty to other parts ofeducation, they are then of a proper age to submit to labour and aregulated diet; for it is impossible for the mind and body both tolabour at the same time, as they are productive of contrary evils toeach other; the labour of the body preventing the progress of the mind,and the mind of the body.CHAPTER VWith respect to music we have already spoken a little in a doubtfulmanner upon this subject. It will be proper to go over again moreparticularly what we then said, which may serve as an introduction towhat any other person may choose to offer thereon; for it is no easymatter to distinctly point out what power it has, nor on what accountsone should apply it, whether as an amusement and refreshment, as sleepor wine; as these are nothing serious, but pleasing, and the killers ofcare, as Euripides says; for which reason they class in the same orderand use for the same purpose all these, namely, sleep, wine, and music,to which some add dancing; or shall we rather suppose that music tendsto be productive of virtue, having a power, as the gymnastic exerciseshave to form the body in a certain way, to influence the manners so asto accustom its professors to rejoice rightly? or shall we say, that itis of any service in the conduct of life, and an assistant to prudence?for this also is a third property which has been attributed to it. Nowthat boys are not to be instructed in it as play is evident; for thosewho learn don't play, for to learn is rather troublesome; neither isit proper to permit boys at their age to enjoy perfect leisure; for tocease to improve is by no means fit for what is as yet imperfect; but itmay be thought that the earnest attention of boys in this art is forthe sake of that amusement they will enjoy when they come to be men andcompletely formed; but, if this is the case, why are they themselvesto learn it, and not follow the practice of the kings of the Medes andPersians, who enjoy the pleasure of music by hearing others play, andbeing shown its beauties by them; for of necessity those must bebetter skilled therein who make this science their particular studyand business, than those who have only spent so much time at it as wassufficient just to learn the principles of it. But if this is a reasonfor a child's being taught anything, they ought also to learn the art ofcookery, but this is absurd. The same doubt occurs if music has a powerof improving the manners; for why should they on this account themselveslearn it, and not reap every advantage of regulating the passions orforming a judgment [1339b] on the merits of the performance by hearingothers, as the Lacedaemonians; for they, without having ever learntmusic, are yet able to judge accurately what is good and what isbad; the same reasoning may be applied if music is supposed to be theamusement of those who live an elegant and easy life, why should theylearn themselves, and not rather enjoy the benefit of others' skill.Let us here consider what is our belief of the immortal gods in thisparticular. Now we find the poets never represent Jupiter himself assinging and playing; nay, we ourselves treat the professors of thesearts as mean people, and say that no one would practise them but adrunkard or a buffoon. But probably we may consider this subject moreat large hereafter. The first question is, whether music is or is notto make a part of education? and of those three things which havebeen assigned as its proper employment, which is the right? Is it toinstruct, to amuse, or to employ the vacant hours of those who live atrest? or may not all three be properly allotted to it? for it appearsto partake of them all; for play is necessary for relaxation, andrelaxation pleasant, as it is a medicine for that uneasiness whicharises from labour. It is admitted also that a happy life must be anhonourable one, and a pleasant one too, since happiness consists in boththese; and we all agree that music is one of the most pleasing things,whether alone or accompanied with a voice; as Musseus says, \"Music's thesweetest joy of man;\" for which reason it is justly admitted into everycompany and every happy life, as having the power of inspiring joy.So that from this any one may suppose that it is necessary to instructyoung persons in it; for all those pleasures which are harmless are notonly conducive to the final end of life, but serve also as relaxations;and, as men are but rarely in the attainment of that final end, theyoften cease from their labour and apply to amusement, with no furtherview than to acquire the pleasure attending it. It is therefore usefulto enjoy such pleasures as these. There are some persons who make playand amusement their end, and probably that end has some pleasure annexedto it, but not what should be; but while men seek the one they acceptthe other for it; because there is some likeness in human actions to theend; for the end is pursued for the sake of nothing else that attendsit; but for itself only; and pleasures like these are sought for, noton account of what follows them, but on account of what has gone beforethem, as labour and grief; for which reason they seek for happiness inthese sort of pleasures; and that this is the reason any one may easilyperceive. That music should be pursued, not on this account only, butalso as it is very serviceable during the hours of relaxation fromlabour, probably no [1340a] one doubts; we should also inquire whetherbesides this use it may not also have another of nobler nature--and weought not only to partake of the common pleasure arising from it (whichall have the sensation of, for music naturally gives pleasure, thereforethe use of it is agreeable to all ages and all dispositions); but alsoto examine if it tends anything to improve our manners and our souls.And this will be easily known if we feel our dispositions any wayinfluenced thereby; and that they are so is evident from many otherinstances, as well as the music at the Olympic games; and thisconfessedly fills the soul with enthusiasm; but enthusiasm is anaffection of the soul which strongly agitates the disposition. Besides,all those who hear any imitations sympathise therewith; and this whenthey are conveyed even without rhythm or verse. Moreover, as music isone of those things which are pleasant, and as virtue itself consists inrightly enjoying, loving, and hating, it is evident that we ought notto learn or accustom ourselves to anything so much as to judge right andrejoice in honourable manners and noble actions. But anger and mildness,courage and modesty, and their contraries, as well as all otherdispositions of the mind, are most naturally imitated by music andpoetry; which is plain by experience, for when we hear these our verysoul is altered; and he who is affected either with joy or grief by theimitation of any objects, is in very nearly the same situation as if hewas affected by the objects themselves; thus, if any person is pleasedwith seeing a statue of any one on no other account but its beauty, itis evident that the sight of the original from whence it was takenwould also be pleasing; now it happens in the other senses there is noimitation of manners; that is to say, in the touch and the taste; in theobjects of sight, a very little; for these are merely representations ofthings, and the perceptions which they excite are in a manner commonto all. Besides, statues and paintings are not properly imitations ofmanners, but rather signs and marks which show the body is affected bysome passion. However, the difference is not great, yet young men oughtnot to view the paintings of Pauso, but of Polygnotus, or any otherpainter or statuary who expresses manners. But in poetry and music thereare imitations of manners; and this is evident, for different harmoniesdiffer from each other so much by nature, that those who hear them aredifferently affected, and are not in the same disposition of mind whenone is performed as when another is; the one, for instance, occasionsgrief 13406 and contracts the soul, as the mixed Lydian: others softenthe mind, and as it were dissolve the heart: others fix it in a firmand settled state, such is the power of the Doric music only; while thePhrygian fills the soul with enthusiasm, as has been well described bythose who have written philosophically upon this part of education; forthey bring examples of what they advance from the things themselves. Thesame holds true with respect to rhythm; some fix the disposition, othersoccasion a change in it; some act more violently, others more liberally.From what has been said it is evident what an influence music has overthe disposition of the mind, and how variously it can fascinate it:and if it can do this, most certainly it is what youth ought to beinstructed in. And indeed the learning of music is particularly adaptedto their disposition; for at their time of life they do not willinglyattend to anything which is not agreeable; but music is naturally oneof the most agreeable things; and there seems to be a certain connectionbetween harmony and rhythm; for which reason some wise men held the soulitself to be harmony; others, that it contains it.CHAPTER VIWe will now determine whether it is proper that children should betaught to sing, and play upon any instrument, which we have before madea matter of doubt. Now, it is well known that it makes a great deal ofdifference when you would qualify any one in any art, for the personhimself to learn the practical part of it; for it is a thing verydifficult, if not impossible, for a man to be a good judge of what hehimself cannot do. It is also very necessary that children should havesome employment which will amuse them; for which reason the rattle ofArchytas seems well contrived, which they give children to play with,to prevent their breaking those things which are about the house; forat their age they cannot sit still: this therefore is well adapted toinfants, as instruction ought to be their rattle as they grow up; henceit is evident that they should be so taught music as to be able topractise it. Nor is it difficult to say what is becoming or unbecomingof their age, or to answer the objections which some make to thisemployment as mean and low. In the first place, it is necessary for themto practise, that they may be judges of the art: for which reason thisshould be done when they are young; but when they are grown older thepractical part may be dropped; while they will still continue judges ofwhat is excellent in the art, and take a proper pleasure therein, fromthe knowledge they acquired of it in their youth. As to the censurewhich some persons throw upon music, as something mean and low, it isnot difficult to answer that, if we will but consider how far we proposethose who are to be educated so as to become good citizens should beinstructed in this art, [1341a] and what music and what rhythms theyshould be acquainted with; and also what instruments they should playupon; for in these there is probably a difference. Such then is theproper answer to that censure: for it must be admitted, that in somecases nothing can prevent music being attended, to a certain degree,with the bad effects which are ascribed to it; it is therefore clearthat the learning of it should never prevent the business of riperyears; nor render the body effeminate, and unfit for the business of waror the state; but it should be practised by the young, judged of by theold. That children may learn music properly, it is necessary that theyshould not be employed in those parts of it which are the objects ofdispute between the masters in that science; nor should they performsuch pieces as are wondered at from the difficulty of their execution;and which, from being first exhibited in the public games, are nowbecome a part of education; but let them learn so much of it as to beable to receive proper pleasure from excellent music and rhythms; andnot that only which music must make all animals feel, and also slavesand boys, but more. It is therefore plain what instruments they shoulduse; thus, they should never be taught to play upon the flute, or anyother instrument which requires great skill, as the harp or the like,but on such as will make them good judges of music, or any otherinstruction: besides, the flute is not a moral instrument, but ratherone that will inflame the passions, and is therefore rather to be usedwhen the soul is to be animated than when instruction is intended. Letme add also, that there is something therein which is quite contrary towhat education requires; as the player on the flute is prevented fromspeaking: for which reason our forefathers very properly forbade the useof it to youth and freemen, though they themselves at first used it; forwhen their riches procured them greater leisure, they grew more animatedin the cause of virtue; and both before and after the Median war theirnoble actions so exalted their minds that they attended to every part ofeducation; selecting no one in particular, but endeavouring to collectthe whole: for which reason they introduced the flute also, as oneof the instruments they were to learn to play on. At Lacedaemon thechoregus himself played on the flute; and it was so common at Athensthat almost every freeman understood it, as is evident from the tabletwhich Thrasippus dedicated when he was choregus; but afterwards theyrejected it as dangerous; having become better judges of what tended topromote virtue and what did not. For the same reason many of the ancientinstruments were thrown aside, as the dulcimer and the lyre; as alsothose which were to inspire those who played on them with pleasure, andwhich required a nice finger and great skill to play well on. What theancients tell us, by way of fable, of the flute is indeed very rational;namely, that after Minerva had found it, she threw it away: nor are theywrong who say that the goddess disliked it for deforming the face of himwho played thereon: not but that it is more probable that she rejectedit as the knowledge thereof contributed nothing to the improvement ofthe mind. Now, we regard Minerva as the inventress of arts and sciences.As we disapprove of a child's being taught to understand instruments,and to play like a master (which we would have confined to those who arecandidates for the prize in that science; for they play not to improvethemselves in virtue, but to please those who hear them, and gratifytheir importunity); therefore we think the practice of it unfit forfreemen; but then it should be confined to those who are paid for doingit; for it usually gives people sordid notions, for the end they havein view is bad: for the impertinent spectator is accustomed to make themchange their music; so that the artists who attend to him regulate theirbodies according to his motions.CHAPTER VIIWe are now to enter into an inquiry concerning harmony and rhythm;whether all sorts of these are to be employed in education, or whethersome peculiar ones are to be selected; and also whether we shouldgive the same directions to those who are engaged in music as part ofeducation, or whether there is something different from these two.Now, as all music consists in melody and rhythm, we ought not to beunacquainted with the power which each of these has in education; andwhether we should rather choose music in which melody prevails, orrhythm: but when I consider how many things have been well written uponthese subjects, not only by some musicians of the present age, but alsoby some philosophers who are perfectly skilled in that part of musicwhich belongs to education; we will refer those who desire a veryparticular knowledge therein to those writers, and shall only treatof it in general terms, without descending to particulars. Melody isdivided by some philosophers, whose notions we approve of, into moral,practical, and that which fills the mind with enthusiasm: they alsoallot to each of these a particular kind of harmony which naturallycorresponds therewith: and we say that music should not be applied toone purpose only, but many; both for instruction and purifying the soul(now I use the word purifying at present without any explanation, butshall speak more at large of it in my Poetics); and, in the third place,as an agreeable manner of spending the time and a relaxation from theuneasiness of the mind. [1342a] It is evident that all harmonies are tobe used; but not for all purposes; but the most moral in education: butto please the ear, when others play, the most active and enthusiastic;for that passion which is to be found very strong in some souls is to bemet with also in all; but the difference in different persons consistsin its being in a less or greater degree, as pity, fear, and enthusiasmalso; which latter is so powerful in some as to overpower the soul: andyet we see those persons, by the application of sacred music to soothetheir mind, rendered as sedate and composed as if they had employedthe art of the physician: and this must necessarily happen to thecompassionate, the fearful, and all those who are subdued by theirpassions: nay, all persons, as far as they are affected with thosepassions, admit of the same cure, and are restored to tranquillity withpleasure. In the same manner, all music which has the power of purifyingthe soul affords a harmless pleasure to man. Such, therefore, should bethe harmony and such the music which those who contend with each otherin the theatre should exhibit: but as the audience is composed of twosorts of people, the free and the well-instructed, the rude the meanmechanics, and hired servants, and a long collection of the like, theremust be some music and some spectacles to please and soothe them; for astheir minds are as it were perverted from their natural habits, soalso is there an unnatural harmony, and overcharged music which isaccommodated to their taste: but what is according to nature givespleasure to every one, therefore those who are to contend upon thetheatre should be allowed to use this species of music. But in educationethic melody and ethic harmony should be used, which is the Doric, as wehave already said, or any other which those philosophers who are skilfulin that music which is to be employed in education shall approve of.But Socrates, in Plato's Republic, is very wrong when he [1342b] permitsonly the Phrygian music to be used as well as the Doric, particularly asamongst other instruments he banishes the flute; for the Phrygian musichas the same power in harmony as the flute has amongst the instruments;for they are both pathetic and raise the mind: and this the practiceof the poets proves; for in their bacchanal songs, or whenever theydescribe any violent emotions of the mind, the flute is the instrumentthey chiefly use: and the Phrygian harmony is most suitable to thesesubjects. Now, that the dithyrambic measure is Phrygian is allowed bygeneral consent; and those who are conversant in studies of this sortbring many proofs of it; as, for instance, when Philoxenus endeavouredto compose dithyrambic music for Doric harmony, he naturally fell backagain into Phrygian, as being fittest for that purpose; as every oneindeed agrees, that the Doric music is most serious, and fittest toinspire courage: and, as we always commend the middle as being betweenthe two extremes, and the Doric has this relation with respect to otherharmonies, it is evident that is what the youth ought to be instructedin. There are two things to be taken into consideration, both what ispossible and what is proper; every one then should chiefly endeavour toattain those things which contain both these qualities: but this is tobe regulated by different times of life; for instance, it is not easyfor those who are advanced in years to sing such pieces of music asrequire very high notes, for nature points out to them those which aregentle and require little strength of voice (for which reason some whoare skilful in music justly find fault with Socrates for forbidding theyouth to be instructed in gentle harmony; as if, like wine, it wouldmake them drunk, whereas the effect of that is to render men bacchanals,and not make them languid): these therefore are what should employ thosewho are grown old. Moreover, if there is any harmony which is proper fora child's age, as being at the same time elegant and instructive, as theLydian of all others seems chiefly to be-These then are as it were thethree boundaries of education, moderation, possibility, and decorum.", "1Our subject being Poetry, I propose to speak not only of the art ingeneral but also of its species and their respective capacities; of thestructure of plot required for a good poem; of the number and nature ofthe constituent parts of a poem; and likewise of any other matters inthe same line of inquiry. Let us follow the natural order and begin withthe primary facts.Epic poetry and Tragedy, as also Comedy, Dithyrambic poetry, and mostflute-playing and lyre-playing, are all, viewed as a whole, modes ofimitation. But at the same time they differ from one another in threeways, either by a difference of kind in their means, or by differencesin the objects, or in the manner of their imitations.I. Just as form and colour are used as means by some, who (whether byart or constant practice) imitate and portray many things by their aid,and the voice is used by others; so also in the above-mentioned groupof arts, the means with them as a whole are rhythm, language, andharmony--used, however, either singly or in certain combinations. Acombination of rhythm and harmony alone is the means in flute-playingand lyre-playing, and any other arts there may be of the samedescription, e.g. imitative piping. Rhythm alone, without harmony, isthe means in the dancer's imitations; for even he, by the rhythms of hisattitudes, may represent men's characters, as well as what they doand suffer. There is further an art which imitates by language alone,without harmony, in prose or in verse, and if in verse, either in someone or in a plurality of metres. This form of imitation is to thisday without a name. We have no common name for a mime of Sophron orXenarchus and a Socratic Conversation; and we should still be withoutone even if the imitation in the two instances were in trimeters orelegiacs or some other kind of verse--though it is the way with peopleto tack on 'poet' to the name of a metre, and talk of elegiac-poetsand epic-poets, thinking that they call them poets not by reason of theimitative nature of their work, but indiscriminately by reason of themetre they write in. Even if a theory of medicine or physical philosophybe put forth in a metrical form, it is usual to describe the writer inthis way; Homer and Empedocles, however, have really nothing in commonapart from their metre; so that, if the one is to be called a poet, theother should be termed a physicist rather than a poet. We should be inthe same position also, if the imitation in these instances were in allthe metres, like the _Centaur_ (a rhapsody in a medley of all metres) ofChaeremon; and Chaeremon one has to recognize as a poet. So much, then,as to these arts. There are, lastly, certain other arts, which combineall the means enumerated, rhythm, melody, and verse, e.g. Dithyrambicand Nomic poetry, Tragedy and Comedy; with this difference, however,that the three kinds of means are in some of them all employed together,and in others brought in separately, one after the other. These elementsof difference in the above arts I term the means of their imitation.2II. The objects the imitator represents are actions, with agents who arenecessarily either good men or bad--the diversities of human characterbeing nearly always derivative from this primary distinction, since theline between virtue and vice is one dividing the whole of mankind. Itfollows, therefore, that the agents represented must be either above ourown level of goodness, or beneath it, or just such as we are in the sameway as, with the painters, the personages of Polygnotus are betterthan we are, those of Pauson worse, and those of Dionysius just likeourselves. It is clear that each of the above-mentioned arts willadmit of these differences, and that it will become a separate art byrepresenting objects with this point of difference. Even in dancing,flute-playing, and lyre-playing such diversities are possible; and theyare also possible in the nameless art that uses language, prose or versewithout harmony, as its means; Homer's personages, for instance, arebetter than we are; Cleophon's are on our own level; and those ofHegemon of Thasos, the first writer of parodies, and Nicochares,the author of the _Diliad_, are beneath it. The same is true of theDithyramb and the Nome: the personages may be presented in them with thedifference exemplified in the... of... and Argas, and in the Cyclopsesof Timotheus and Philoxenus. This difference it is that distinguishesTragedy and Comedy also; the one would make its personages worse, andthe other better, than the men of the present day.3III. A third difference in these arts is in the manner in which eachkind of object is represented. Given both the same means and the samekind of object for imitation, one may either (1) speak at one moment innarrative and at another in an assumed character, as Homer does; or (2)one may remain the same throughout, without any such change; or (3) theimitators may represent the whole story dramatically, as though theywere actually doing the things described.As we said at the beginning, therefore, the differences in the imitationof these arts come under three heads, their means, their objects, andtheir manner.So that as an imitator Sophocles will be on one side akin to Homer, bothportraying good men; and on another to Aristophanes, since both presenttheir personages as acting and doing. This in fact, according to some,is the reason for plays being termed dramas, because in a play thepersonages act the story. Hence too both Tragedy and Comedy are claimedby the Dorians as their discoveries; Comedy by the Megarians--by thosein Greece as having arisen when Megara became a democracy, and by theSicilian Megarians on the ground that the poet Epicharmus was of theircountry, and a good deal earlier than Chionides and Magnes; even Tragedyalso is claimed by certain of the Peloponnesian Dorians. In support ofthis claim they point to the words 'comedy' and 'drama'. Their word forthe outlying hamlets, they say, is comae, whereas Athenians call themdemes--thus assuming that comedians got the name not from their _comoe_or revels, but from their strolling from hamlet to hamlet, lack ofappreciation keeping them out of the city. Their word also for 'to act',they say, is _dran_, whereas Athenians use _prattein_.So much, then, as to the number and nature of the points of differencein the imitation of these arts.4It is clear that the general origin of poetry was due to two causes,each of them part of human nature. Imitation is natural to man fromchildhood, one of his advantages over the lower animals being this, thathe is the most imitative creature in the world, and learns at firstby imitation. And it is also natural for all to delight in works ofimitation. The truth of this second point is shown by experience: thoughthe objects themselves may be painful to see, we delight to view themost realistic representations of them in art, the forms for example ofthe lowest animals and of dead bodies. The explanation is to be foundin a further fact: to be learning something is the greatest of pleasuresnot only to the philosopher but also to the rest of mankind, howeversmall their capacity for it; the reason of the delight in seeing thepicture is that one is at the same time learning--gathering the meaningof things, e.g. that the man there is so-and-so; for if one has notseen the thing before, one's pleasure will not be in the picture as animitation of it, but will be due to the execution or colouring or somesimilar cause. Imitation, then, being natural to us--as also the senseof harmony and rhythm, the metres being obviously species of rhythms--itwas through their original aptitude, and by a series of improvements forthe most part gradual on their first efforts, that they created poetryout of their improvisations.Poetry, however, soon broke up into two kinds according to thedifferences of character in the individual poets; for the graver amongthem would represent noble actions, and those of noble personages; andthe meaner sort the actions of the ignoble. The latter class producedinvectives at first, just as others did hymns and panegyrics. We know ofno such poem by any of the pre-Homeric poets, though there were probablymany such writers among them; instances, however, may be found fromHomer downwards, e.g. his _Margites_, and the similar poems of others.In this poetry of invective its natural fitness brought an iambic metreinto use; hence our present term 'iambic', because it was the metre oftheir 'iambs' or invectives against one another. The result was thatthe old poets became some of them writers of heroic and others of iambicverse. Homer's position, however, is peculiar: just as he was in theserious style the poet of poets, standing alone not only through theliterary excellence, but also through the dramatic character of hisimitations, so too he was the first to outline for us the general formsof Comedy by producing not a dramatic invective, but a dramatic pictureof the Ridiculous; his _Margites_ in fact stands in the same relationto our comedies as the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ to our tragedies. As soon,however, as Tragedy and Comedy appeared in the field, those naturallydrawn to the one line of poetry became writers of comedies instead ofiambs, and those naturally drawn to the other, writers of tragediesinstead of epics, because these new modes of art were grander and ofmore esteem than the old.If it be asked whether Tragedy is now all that it need be in itsformative elements, to consider that, and decide it theoretically and inrelation to the theatres, is a matter for another inquiry.It certainly began in improvisations--as did also Comedy; the oneoriginating with the authors of the Dithyramb, the other with those ofthe phallic songs, which still survive as institutions in many of ourcities. And its advance after that was little by little, through theirimproving on whatever they had before them at each stage. It was in factonly after a long series of changes that the movement of Tragedy stoppedon its attaining to its natural form. (1) The number of actors was firstincreased to two by Aeschylus, who curtailed the business of the Chorus,and made the dialogue, or spoken portion, take the leading part in theplay. (2) A third actor and scenery were due to Sophocles. (3) Tragedyacquired also its magnitude. Discarding short stories and a ludicrousdiction, through its passing out of its satyric stage, it assumed,though only at a late point in its progress, a tone of dignity; andits metre changed then from trochaic to iambic. The reason for theiroriginal use of the trochaic tetrameter was that their poetry wassatyric and more connected with dancing than it now is. As soon,however, as a spoken part came in, nature herself found the appropriatemetre. The iambic, we know, is the most speakable of metres, as is shownby the fact that we very often fall into it in conversation, whereas werarely talk hexameters, and only when we depart from the speaking toneof voice. (4) Another change was a plurality of episodes or acts. As forthe remaining matters, the superadded embellishments and the account oftheir introduction, these must be taken as said, as it would probably bea long piece of work to go through the details.5As for Comedy, it is (as has been observed) an imitation of men worsethan the average; worse, however, not as regards any and every sort offault, but only as regards one particular kind, the Ridiculous, whichis a species of the Ugly. The Ridiculous may be defined as a mistakeor deformity not productive of pain or harm to others; the mask, forinstance, that excites laughter, is something ugly and distorted withoutcausing pain.Though the successive changes in Tragedy and their authors are notunknown, we cannot say the same of Comedy; its early stages passedunnoticed, because it was not as yet taken up in a serious way. It wasonly at a late point in its progress that a chorus of comedians wasofficially granted by the archon; they used to be mere volunteers. Ithad also already certain definite forms at the time when the record ofthose termed comic poets begins. Who it was who supplied it with masks,or prologues, or a plurality of actors and the like, has remainedunknown. The invented Fable, or Plot, however, originated in Sicily,with Epicharmus and Phormis; of Athenian poets Crates was the firstto drop the Comedy of invective and frame stories of a general andnon-personal nature, in other words, Fables or Plots.Epic poetry, then, has been seen to agree with Tragedy to this extent,that of being an imitation of serious subjects in a grand kind of verse.It differs from it, however, (1) in that it is in one kind of verse andin narrative form; and (2) in its length--which is due to its actionhaving no fixed limit of time, whereas Tragedy endeavours to keep as faras possible within a single circuit of the sun, or something near that.This, I say, is another point of difference between them, though atfirst the practice in this respect was just the same in tragedies asin epic poems. They differ also (3) in their constituents, some beingcommon to both and others peculiar to Tragedy--hence a judge of good andbad in Tragedy is a judge of that in epic poetry also. All the parts ofan epic are included in Tragedy; but those of Tragedy are not all ofthem to be found in the Epic.6Reserving hexameter poetry and Comedy for consideration hereafter, letus proceed now to the discussion of Tragedy; before doing so, however,we must gather up the definition resulting from what has been said. Atragedy, then, is the imitation of an action that is serious and also,as having magnitude, complete in itself; in language with pleasurableaccessories, each kind brought in separately in the parts of the work;in a dramatic, not in a narrative form; with incidents arousing pity andfear, wherewith to accomplish its catharsis of such emotions. Here by'language with pleasurable accessories' I mean that with rhythm andharmony or song superadded; and by 'the kinds separately' I mean thatsome portions are worked out with verse only, and others in turn withsong.I. As they act the stories, it follows that in the first place theSpectacle (or stage-appearance of the actors) must be some part of thewhole; and in the second Melody and Diction, these two being themeans of their imitation. Here by 'Diction' I mean merely this, thecomposition of the verses; and by 'Melody', what is too completelyunderstood to require explanation. But further: the subject representedalso is an action; and the action involves agents, who must necessarilyhave their distinctive qualities both of character and thought, since itis from these that we ascribe certain qualities to their actions. Thereare in the natural order of things, therefore, two causes, Character andThought, of their actions, and consequently of their success or failurein their lives. Now the action (that which was done) is represented inthe play by the Fable or Plot. The Fable, in our present sense of theterm, is simply this, the combination of the incidents, or things donein the story; whereas Character is what makes us ascribe certain moralqualities to the agents; and Thought is shown in all they say whenproving a particular point or, it may be, enunciating a general truth.There are six parts consequently of every tragedy, as a whole, thatis, of such or such quality, viz. a Fable or Plot, Characters, Diction,Thought, Spectacle and Melody; two of them arising from the means, onefrom the manner, and three from the objects of the dramatic imitation;and there is nothing else besides these six. Of these, its formativeelements, then, not a few of the dramatists have made due use, as everyplay, one may say, admits of Spectacle, Character, Fable, Diction,Melody, and Thought.II. The most important of the six is the combination of the incidents ofthe story.Tragedy is essentially an imitation not of persons but of action andlife, of happiness and misery. All human happiness or misery takes theform of action; the end for which we live is a certain kind ofactivity, not a quality. Character gives us qualities, but it is inour actions--what we do--that we are happy or the reverse. In a playaccordingly they do not act in order to portray the Characters; theyinclude the Characters for the sake of the action. So that it is theaction in it, i.e. its Fable or Plot, that is the end and purpose ofthe tragedy; and the end is everywhere the chief thing. Besides this,a tragedy is impossible without action, but there may be one withoutCharacter. The tragedies of most of the moderns are characterless--adefect common among poets of all kinds, and with its counterpart inpainting in Zeuxis as compared with Polygnotus; for whereas the latteris strong in character, the work of Zeuxis is devoid of it. And again:one may string together a series of characteristic speeches of theutmost finish as regards Diction and Thought, and yet fail to producethe true tragic effect; but one will have much better success witha tragedy which, however inferior in these respects, has a Plot, acombination of incidents, in it. And again: the most powerful elementsof attraction in Tragedy, the Peripeties and Discoveries, are parts ofthe Plot. A further proof is in the fact that beginners succeed earlierwith the Diction and Characters than with the construction of astory; and the same may be said of nearly all the early dramatists. Wemaintain, therefore, that the first essential, the life and soul, soto speak, of Tragedy is the Plot; and that the Characters comesecond--compare the parallel in painting, where the most beautifulcolours laid on without order will not give one the same pleasure as asimple black-and-white sketch of a portrait. We maintain that Tragedy isprimarily an imitation of action, and that it is mainly for the sake ofthe action that it imitates the personal agents. Third comes the elementof Thought, i.e. the power of saying whatever can be said, or what isappropriate to the occasion. This is what, in the speeches in Tragedy,falls under the arts of Politics and Rhetoric; for the older poetsmake their personages discourse like statesmen, and the moderns likerhetoricians. One must not confuse it with Character. Character in aplay is that which reveals the moral purpose of the agents, i.e. thesort of thing they seek or avoid, where that is not obvious--hence thereis no room for Character in a speech on a purely indifferent subject.Thought, on the other hand, is shown in all they say when provingor disproving some particular point, or enunciating some universalproposition. Fourth among the literary elements is the Diction of thepersonages, i.e. as before explained, the expression of their thoughtsin words, which is practically the same thing with verse as with prose.As for the two remaining parts, the Melody is the greatest of thepleasurable accessories of Tragedy. The Spectacle, though an attraction,is the least artistic of all the parts, and has least to do with theart of poetry. The tragic effect is quite possible without a publicperformance and actors; and besides, the getting-up of the Spectacle ismore a matter for the costumier than the poet.7Having thus distinguished the parts, let us now consider the properconstruction of the Fable or Plot, as that is at once the first and themost important thing in Tragedy. We have laid it down that a tragedy isan imitation of an action that is complete in itself, as a whole of somemagnitude; for a whole may be of no magnitude to speak of. Now a wholeis that which has beginning, middle, and end. A beginning is that whichis not itself necessarily after anything else, and which has naturallysomething else after it; an end is that which is naturally aftersomething itself, either as its necessary or usual consequent, and withnothing else after it; and a middle, that which is by nature after onething and has also another after it. A well-constructed Plot, therefore,cannot either begin or end at any point one likes; beginning and end init must be of the forms just described. Again: to be beautiful, a livingcreature, and every whole made up of parts, must not only present acertain order in its arrangement of parts, but also be of a certaindefinite magnitude. Beauty is a matter of size and order, and thereforeimpossible either (1) in a very minute creature, since our perceptionbecomes indistinct as it approaches instantaneity; or (2) in a creatureof vast size--one, say, 1,000 miles long--as in that case, instead ofthe object being seen all at once, the unity and wholeness of it is lostto the beholder.Just in the same way, then, as a beautiful whole made up of parts, or abeautiful living creature, must be of some size, a size to be taken inby the eye, so a story or Plot must be of some length, but of a lengthto be taken in by the memory. As for the limit of its length, so far asthat is relative to public performances and spectators, it does not fallwithin the theory of poetry. If they had to perform a hundred tragedies,they would be timed by water-clocks, as they are said to have been atone period. The limit, however, set by the actual nature of the thing isthis: the longer the story, consistently with its being comprehensibleas a whole, the finer it is by reason of its magnitude. As a roughgeneral formula, 'a length which allows of the hero passing by a seriesof probable or necessary stages from misfortune to happiness, or fromhappiness to misfortune', may suffice as a limit for the magnitude ofthe story.8The Unity of a Plot does not consist, as some suppose, in its having oneman as its subject. An infinity of things befall that one man, some ofwhich it is impossible to reduce to unity; and in like manner there aremany actions of one man which cannot be made to form one action.One sees, therefore, the mistake of all the poets who have written a_Heracleid_, a _Theseid_, or similar poems; they suppose that, becauseHeracles was one man, the story also of Heracles must be one story.Homer, however, evidently understood this point quite well, whetherby art or instinct, just in the same way as he excels the rest in everyother respect. In writing an _Odyssey_, he did not make the poem coverall that ever befell his hero--it befell him, for instance, to getwounded on Parnassus and also to feign madness at the time of the callto arms, but the two incidents had no probable or necessary connexionwith one another--instead of doing that, he took an action with a Unityof the kind we are describing as the subject of the _Odyssey_, as alsoof the _Iliad_. The truth is that, just as in the other imitative artsone imitation is always of one thing, so in poetry the story, as animitation of action, must represent one action, a complete whole,with its several incidents so closely connected that the transposal orwithdrawal of any one of them will disjoin and dislocate the whole. Forthat which makes no perceptible difference by its presence or absence isno real part of the whole.9From what we have said it will be seen that the poet's function is todescribe, not the thing that has happened, but a kind of thing thatmight happen, i.e. what is possible as being probable or necessary. Thedistinction between historian and poet is not in the one writing proseand the other verse--you might put the work of Herodotus into verse, andit would still be a species of history; it consists really in this, thatthe one describes the thing that has been, and the other a kind of thingthat might be. Hence poetry is something more philosophic and of graverimport than history, since its statements are of the nature ratherof universals, whereas those of history are singulars. By a universalstatement I mean one as to what such or such a kind of man will probablyor necessarily say or do--which is the aim of poetry, though it affixesproper names to the characters; by a singular statement, one as to what,say, Alcibiades did or had done to him. In Comedy this has become clearby this time; it is only when their plot is already made up of probableincidents that they give it a basis of proper names, choosing for thepurpose any names that may occur to them, instead of writing like theold iambic poets about particular persons. In Tragedy, however, theystill adhere to the historic names; and for this reason: what convincesis the possible; now whereas we are not yet sure as to the possibilityof that which has not happened, that which has happened is manifestlypossible, else it would not have come to pass. Nevertheless even inTragedy there are some plays with but one or two known names in them,the rest being inventions; and there are some without a single knownname, e.g. Agathon's Anthens, in which both incidents and names are ofthe poet's invention; and it is no less delightful on that account. Sothat one must not aim at a rigid adherence to the traditional storieson which tragedies are based. It would be absurd, in fact, to do so,as even the known stories are only known to a few, though they are adelight none the less to all.It is evident from the above that, the poet must be more the poet of hisstories or Plots than of his verses, inasmuch as he is a poet byvirtue of the imitative element in his work, and it is actions that heimitates. And if he should come to take a subject from actual history,he is none the less a poet for that; since some historic occurrences mayvery well be in the probable and possible order of things; and it is inthat aspect of them that he is their poet.Of simple Plots and actions the episodic are the worst. I call a Plotepisodic when there is neither probability nor necessity in the sequenceof episodes. Actions of this sort bad poets construct through theirown fault, and good ones on account of the players. His work being forpublic performance, a good poet often stretches out a Plot beyond itscapabilities, and is thus obliged to twist the sequence of incident.Tragedy, however, is an imitation not only of a complete action, butalso of incidents arousing pity and fear. Such incidents have the verygreatest effect on the mind when they occur unexpectedly and at the sametime in consequence of one another; there is more of the marvellous inthem then than if they happened of themselves or by mere chance. Evenmatters of chance seem most marvellous if there is an appearance ofdesign as it were in them; as for instance the statue of Mitys atArgos killed the author of Mitys' death by falling down on him when alooker-on at a public spectacle; for incidents like that we think to benot without a meaning. A Plot, therefore, of this sort is necessarilyfiner than others.10Plots are either simple or complex, since the actions they represent arenaturally of this twofold description. The action, proceeding in the waydefined, as one continuous whole, I call simple, when the change in thehero's fortunes takes place without Peripety or Discovery; and complex,when it involves one or the other, or both. These should each ofthem arise out of the structure of the Plot itself, so as to be theconsequence, necessary or probable, of the antecedents. There is a greatdifference between a thing happening _propter hoc_ and _post hoc_.11A Peripety is the change from one state of things within the play to itsopposite of the kind described, and that too in the way we are saying,in the probable or necessary sequence of events; as it is for instancein _Oedipus_: here the opposite state of things is produced by theMessenger, who, coming to gladden Oedipus and to remove his fears as tohis mother, reveals the secret of his birth. And in _Lynceus_: just ashe is being led off for execution, with Danaus at his side to put him todeath, the incidents preceding this bring it about that he is saved andDanaus put to death. A Discovery is, as the very word implies, a changefrom ignorance to knowledge, and thus to either love or hate, in thepersonages marked for good or evil fortune. The finest form of Discoveryis one attended by Peripeties, like that which goes with the Discoveryin _Oedipus_. There are no doubt other forms of it; what we have saidmay happen in a way in reference to inanimate things, even things of avery casual kind; and it is also possible to discover whether some onehas done or not done something. But the form most directly connectedwith the Plot and the action of the piece is the first-mentioned. This,with a Peripety, will arouse either pity or fear--actions of that naturebeing what Tragedy is assumed to represent; and it will also serve tobring about the happy or unhappy ending. The Discovery, then, being ofpersons, it may be that of one party only to the other, the latter beingalready known; or both the parties may have to discover themselves.Iphigenia, for instance, was discovered to Orestes by sending theletter; and another Discovery was required to reveal him to Iphigenia.Two parts of the Plot, then, Peripety and Discovery, are on matters ofthis sort. A third part is Suffering; which we may define as an actionof a destructive or painful nature, such as murders on the stage,tortures, woundings, and the like. The other two have been alreadyexplained.12The parts of Tragedy to be treated as formative elements in the wholewere mentioned in a previous Chapter. From the point of view, however,of its quantity, i.e. the separate sections into which it is divided, atragedy has the following parts: Prologue, Episode, Exode, and a choralportion, distinguished into Parode and Stasimon; these two are common toall tragedies, whereas songs from the stage and Commoe are only foundin some. The Prologue is all that precedes the Parode of the chorus; anEpisode all that comes in between two whole choral songs; the Exodeall that follows after the last choral song. In the choral portion theParode is the whole first statement of the chorus; a Stasimon, a song ofthe chorus without anapaests or trochees; a Commas, a lamentation sungby chorus and actor in concert. The parts of Tragedy to be used asformative elements in the whole we have already mentioned; the aboveare its parts from the point of view of its quantity, or the separatesections into which it is divided.13The next points after what we have said above will be these: (1) What isthe poet to aim at, and what is he to avoid, in constructing his Plots?and (2) What are the conditions on which the tragic effect depends?We assume that, for the finest form of Tragedy, the Plot must be notsimple but complex; and further, that it must imitate actions arousingpity and fear, since that is the distinctive function of this kind ofimitation. It follows, therefore, that there are three forms of Plot tobe avoided. (1) A good man must not be seen passing from happiness tomisery, or (2) a bad man from misery to happiness.The first situation is not fear-inspiring or piteous, but simply odiousto us. The second is the most untragic that can be; it has no one of therequisites of Tragedy; it does not appeal either to the human feeling inus, or to our pity, or to our fears. Nor, on the other hand, should (3)an extremely bad man be seen falling from happiness into misery. Sucha story may arouse the human feeling in us, but it will not move us toeither pity or fear; pity is occasioned by undeserved misfortune, andfear by that of one like ourselves; so that there will be nothing eitherpiteous or fear-inspiring in the situation. There remains, then, theintermediate kind of personage, a man not pre-eminently virtuous andjust, whose misfortune, however, is brought upon him not by vice anddepravity but by some error of judgement, of the number of those in theenjoyment of great reputation and prosperity; e.g. Oedipus, Thyestes,and the men of note of similar families. The perfect Plot, accordingly,must have a single, and not (as some tell us) a double issue; the changein the hero's fortunes must be not from misery to happiness, but on thecontrary from happiness to misery; and the cause of it must lie notin any depravity, but in some great error on his part; the man himselfbeing either such as we have described, or better, not worse, than that.Fact also confirms our theory. Though the poets began by accepting anytragic story that came to hand, in these days the finest tragedies arealways on the story of some few houses, on that of Alemeon, Oedipus,Orestes, Meleager, Thyestes, Telephus, or any others that may have beeninvolved, as either agents or sufferers, in some deed of horror. Thetheoretically best tragedy, then, has a Plot of this description. Thecritics, therefore, are wrong who blame Euripides for taking this linein his tragedies, and giving many of them an unhappy ending. It is, aswe have said, the right line to take. The best proof is this: on thestage, and in the public performances, such plays, properly workedout, are seen to be the most truly tragic; and Euripides, even ifhis elecution be faulty in every other point, is seen to be neverthelessthe most tragic certainly of the dramatists. After this comes theconstruction of Plot which some rank first, one with a double story(like the _Odyssey_) and an opposite issue for the good and the badpersonages. It is ranked as first only through the weakness of theaudiences; the poets merely follow their public, writing as its wishesdictate. But the pleasure here is not that of Tragedy. It belongs ratherto Comedy, where the bitterest enemies in the piece (e.g. Orestes andAegisthus) walk off good friends at the end, with no slaying of any oneby any one.14The tragic fear and pity may be aroused by the Spectacle; but they mayalso be aroused by the very structure and incidents of the play--whichis the better way and shows the better poet. The Plot in fact should beso framed that, even without seeing the things take place, he who simplyhears the account of them shall be filled with horror and pity at theincidents; which is just the effect that the mere recital of the storyin _Oedipus_ would have on one. To produce this same effect by meansof the Spectacle is less artistic, and requires extraneous aid. Those,however, who make use of the Spectacle to put before us that which ismerely monstrous and not productive of fear, are wholly out of touchwith Tragedy; not every kind of pleasure should be required of atragedy, but only its own proper pleasure.The tragic pleasure is that of pity and fear, and the poet has toproduce it by a work of imitation; it is clear, therefore, that thecauses should be included in the incidents of his story. Let us see,then, what kinds of incident strike one as horrible, or rather aspiteous. In a deed of this description the parties must necessarilybe either friends, or enemies, or indifferent to one another. Now whenenemy does it on enemy, there is nothing to move us to pity either inhis doing or in his meditating the deed, except so far as the actualpain of the sufferer is concerned; and the same is true when the partiesare indifferent to one another. Whenever the tragic deed, however, isdone within the family--when murder or the like is done or meditatedby brother on brother, by son on father, by mother on son, or sonon mother--these are the situations the poet should seek after. Thetraditional stories, accordingly, must be kept as they are, e.g. themurder of Clytaemnestra by Orestes and of Eriphyle by Alcmeon. At thesame time even with these there is something left to the poet himself;it is for him to devise the right way of treating them. Let us explainmore clearly what we mean by 'the right way'. The deed of horror may bedone by the doer knowingly and consciously, as in the old poets, andin Medea's murder of her children in Euripides. Or he may do it, but inignorance of his relationship, and discover that afterwards, as does the_Oedipus_ in Sophocles. Here the deed is outside the play; but it maybe within it, like the act of the Alcmeon in Astydamas, or that ofthe Telegonus in _Ulysses Wounded_. A third possibility is forone meditating some deadly injury to another, in ignorance of hisrelationship, to make the discovery in time to draw back. These exhaustthe possibilities, since the deed must necessarily be either done or notdone, and either knowingly or unknowingly.The worst situation is when the personage is with full knowledge on thepoint of doing the deed, and leaves it undone. It is odious and also(through the absence of suffering) untragic; hence it is that no one ismade to act thus except in some few instances, e.g. Haemon and Creon in_Antigone_. Next after this comes the actual perpetration of the deedmeditated. A better situation than that, however, is for the deed tobe done in ignorance, and the relationship discovered afterwards, sincethere is nothing odious in it, and the Discovery will serve to astoundus. But the best of all is the last; what we have in _Cresphontes_, forexample, where Merope, on the point of slaying her son, recognizeshim in time; in _Iphigenia_, where sister and brother are in a likeposition; and in _Helle_, where the son recognizes his mother, when onthe point of giving her up to her enemy.This will explain why our tragedies are restricted (as we said just now)to such a small number of families. It was accident rather than art thatled the poets in quest of subjects to embody this kind of incident intheir Plots. They are still obliged, accordingly, to have recourse tothe families in which such horrors have occurred.On the construction of the Plot, and the kind of Plot required forTragedy, enough has now been said.15In the Characters there are four points to aim at. First and foremost,that they shall be good. There will be an element of character in theplay, if (as has been observed) what a personage says or does reveals acertain moral purpose; and a good element of character, if thepurpose so revealed is good. Such goodness is possible in every typeof personage, even in a woman or a slave, though the one is perhaps aninferior, and the other a wholly worthless being. The second point is tomake them appropriate. The Character before us may be, say, manly; butit is not appropriate in a female Character to be manly, or clever. Thethird is to make them like the reality, which is not the same as theirbeing good and appropriate, in our sense of the term. The fourth is tomake them consistent and the same throughout; even if inconsistencybe part of the man before one for imitation as presenting that formof character, he should still be consistently inconsistent. We have aninstance of baseness of character, not required for the story, inthe Menelaus in _Orestes_; of the incongruous and unbefitting in thelamentation of Ulysses in _Scylla_, and in the (clever) speech ofMelanippe; and of inconsistency in _Iphigenia at Aulis_, where Iphigeniathe suppliant is utterly unlike the later Iphigenia. The right thing,however, is in the Characters just as in the incidents of the play toendeavour always after the necessary or the probable; so that wheneversuch-and-such a personage says or does such-and-such a thing, it shallbe the probable or necessary outcome of his character; and wheneverthis incident follows on that, it shall be either the necessary or theprobable consequence of it. From this one sees (to digress for a moment)that the Denouement also should arise out of the plot itself, aridnot depend on a stage-artifice, as in _Medea_, or in the story of the(arrested) departure of the Greeks in the _Iliad_. The artifice mustbe reserved for matters outside the play--for past events beyond humanknowledge, or events yet to come, which require to be foretold orannounced; since it is the privilege of the Gods to know everything.There should be nothing improbable among the actual incidents. If itbe unavoidable, however, it should be outside the tragedy, like theimprobability in the _Oedipus_ of Sophocles. But to return to theCharacters. As Tragedy is an imitation of personages better thanthe ordinary man, we in our way should follow the example of goodportrait-painters, who reproduce the distinctive features of a man, andat the same time, without losing the likeness, make him handsomer thanhe is. The poet in like manner, in portraying men quick or slow toanger, or with similar infirmities of character, must know how torepresent them as such, and at the same time as good men, as Agathon andHomer have represented Achilles.All these rules one must keep in mind throughout, and further, thosealso for such points of stage-effect as directly depend on the artof the poet, since in these too one may often make mistakes. Enough,however, has been said on the subject in one of our published writings.16Discovery in general has been explained already. As for the species ofDiscovery, the first to be noted is (1) the least artistic form ofit, of which the poets make most use through mere lack of invention,Discovery by signs or marks. Of these signs some are congenital, likethe 'lance-head which the Earth-born have on them', or 'stars', such asCarcinus brings in in his _Thyestes_; others acquired after birth--theselatter being either marks on the body, e.g. scars, or external tokens,like necklaces, or to take another sort of instance, the ark in theDiscovery in _Tyro_. Even these, however, admit of two uses, a betterand a worse; the scar of Ulysses is an instance; the Discovery ofhim through it is made in one way by the nurse and in another by theswineherds. A Discovery using signs as a means of assurance is lessartistic, as indeed are all such as imply reflection; whereas onebringing them in all of a sudden, as in the _Bath-story_, is of a betterorder. Next after these are (2) Discoveries made directly by the poet;which are inartistic for that very reason; e.g. Orestes' Discovery ofhimself in _Iphigenia_: whereas his sister reveals who she is by theletter, Orestes is made to say himself what the poet rather thanthe story demands. This, therefore, is not far removed from thefirst-mentioned fault, since he might have presented certain tokensas well. Another instance is the 'shuttle's voice' in the _Tereus_ ofSophocles. (3) A third species is Discovery through memory, from a man'sconsciousness being awakened by something seen or heard. Thus in _TheCyprioe_ of Dicaeogenes, the sight of the picture makes the man burstinto tears; and in the _Tale of Alcinous_, hearing the harper Ulysses isreminded of the past and weeps; the Discovery of them being theresult. (4) A fourth kind is Discovery through reasoning; e.g. in _TheChoephoroe_: 'One like me is here; there is no one like me but Orestes;he, therefore, must be here.' Or that which Polyidus the Sophistsuggested for _Iphigenia_; since it was natural for Orestes to reflect:'My sister was sacrificed, and I am to be sacrificed like her.' Or thatin the _Tydeus_ of Theodectes: 'I came to find a son, and am to diemyself.' Or that in _The Phinidae_: on seeing the place the womeninferred their fate, that they were to die there, since they had alsobeen exposed there. (5) There is, too, a composite Discovery arisingfrom bad reasoning on the side of the other party. An instance of it isin _Ulysses the False Messenger_: he said he should know the bow--whichhe had not seen; but to suppose from that that he would know it again(as though he had once seen it) was bad reasoning. (6) The best of allDiscoveries, however, is that arising from the incidents themselves,when the great surprise comes about through a probable incident, likethat in the _Oedipus_ of Sophocles; and also in _Iphigenia_; for it wasnot improbable that she should wish to have a letter taken home. Theselast are the only Discoveries independent of the artifice of signs andnecklaces. Next after them come Discoveries through reasoning.17At the time when he is constructing his Plots, and engaged on theDiction in which they are worked out, the poet should remember (1) toput the actual scenes as far as possible before his eyes. In this way,seeing everything with the vividness of an eye-witness as it were,he will devise what is appropriate, and be least likely to overlookincongruities. This is shown by what was censured in Carcinus, thereturn of Amphiaraus from the sanctuary; it would have passed unnoticed,if it had not been actually seen by the audience; but on the stage hisplay failed, the incongruity of the incident offending the spectators.(2) As far as may be, too, the poet should even act his story with thevery gestures of his personages. Given the same natural qualifications,he who feels the emotions to be described will be the most convincing;distress and anger, for instance, are portrayed most truthfully by onewho is feeling them at the moment. Hence it is that poetry demands a manwith special gift for it, or else one with a touch of madness in him;the former can easily assume the required mood, and the latter maybe actually beside himself with emotion. (3) His story, again, whetheralready made or of his own making, he should first simplify and reduceto a universal form, before proceeding to lengthen it out by theinsertion of episodes. The following will show how the universal elementin _Iphigenia_, for instance, may be viewed: A certain maiden havingbeen offered in sacrifice, and spirited away from her sacrificers intoanother land, where the custom was to sacrifice all strangers to theGoddess, she was made there the priestess of this rite. Long after thatthe brother of the priestess happened to come; the fact, however, of theoracle having for a certain reason bidden him go thither, and hisobject in going, are outside the Plot of the play. On his coming hewas arrested, and about to be sacrificed, when he revealed who hewas--either as Euripides puts it, or (as suggested by Polyidus) by thenot improbable exclamation, 'So I too am doomed to be sacrificed, asmy sister was'; and the disclosure led to his salvation. This done, thenext thing, after the proper names have been fixed as a basis for thestory, is to work in episodes or accessory incidents. One must mind,however, that the episodes are appropriate, like the fit of madness inOrestes, which led to his arrest, and the purifying, which brought abouthis salvation. In plays, then, the episodes are short; in epic poetrythey serve to lengthen out the poem. The argument of the _Odyssey_ isnot a long one.A certain man has been abroad many years; Poseidon is ever on the watchfor him, and he is all alone. Matters at home too have come to this,that his substance is being wasted and his son's death plotted bysuitors to his wife. Then he arrives there himself after his grievoussufferings; reveals himself, and falls on his enemies; and the end ishis salvation and their death. This being all that is proper to the_Odyssey_, everything else in it is episode.18(4) There is a further point to be borne in mind. Every tragedy isin part Complication and in part Denouement; the incidents before theopening scene, and often certain also of those within the play, formingthe Complication; and the rest the Denouement. By Complication I meanall from the beginning of the story to the point just before the changein the hero's fortunes; by Denouement, all from the beginning of thechange to the end. In the _Lynceus_ of Theodectes, for instance, theComplication includes, together with the presupposed incidents, theseizure of the child and that in turn of the parents; and the Denouementall from the indictment for the murder to the end. Now it is right, whenone speaks of a tragedy as the same or not the same as another, to do soon the ground before all else of their Plot, i.e. as having the same ornot the same Complication and Denouement. Yet there are many dramatistswho, after a good Complication, fail in the Denouement. But it isnecessary for both points of construction to be always duly mastered.(5) There are four distinct species of Tragedy--that being the numberof the constituents also that have been mentioned: first, the complexTragedy, which is all Peripety and Discovery; second, the Tragedyof suffering, e.g. the _Ajaxes_ and _Ixions_; third, the Tragedy ofcharacter, e.g. _The Phthiotides_ and _Peleus_. The fourth constituentis that of 'Spectacle', exemplified in _The Phorcides_, in _Prometheus_,and in all plays with the scene laid in the nether world. The poet'saim, then, should be to combine every element of interest, if possible,or else the more important and the major part of them. This is nowespecially necessary owing to the unfair criticism to which the poet issubjected in these days. Just because there have been poets before himstrong in the several species of tragedy, the critics now expect theone man to surpass that which was the strong point of each one of hispredecessors. (6) One should also remember what has been said more thanonce, and not write a tragedy on an epic body of incident (i.e. one witha plurality of stories in it), by attempting to dramatize, for instance,the entire story of the _Iliad_. In the epic owing to its scale everypart is treated at proper length; with a drama, however, on the samestory the result is very disappointing. This is shown by the fact thatall who have dramatized the fall of Ilium in its entirety, and not partby part, like Euripides, or the whole of the Niobe story, instead of aportion, like Aeschylus, either fail utterly or have but ill successon the stage; for that and that alone was enough to ruin a play byAgathon. Yet in their Peripeties, as also in their simple plots, thepoets I mean show wonderful skill in aiming at the kind of effect theydesire--a tragic situation that arouses the human feeling in one, likethe clever villain (e.g. Sisyphus) deceived, or the brave wrongdoerworsted. This is probable, however, only in Agathon's sense, when hespeaks of the probability of even improbabilities coming to pass. (7)The Chorus too should be regarded as one of the actors; it should be anintegral part of the whole, and take a share in the action--that whichit has in Sophocles rather than in Euripides. With the later poets,however, the songs in a play of theirs have no more to do with the Plotof that than of any other tragedy. Hence it is that they are now singingintercalary pieces, a practice first introduced by Agathon. And yet whatreal difference is there between singing such intercalary pieces, andattempting to fit in a speech, or even a whole act, from one play intoanother?19The Plot and Characters having been discussed, it remains to considerthe Diction and Thought. As for the Thought, we may assume what issaid of it in our Art of Rhetoric, as it belongs more properly tothat department of inquiry. The Thought of the personages is shown ineverything to be effected by their language--in every effort to proveor disprove, to arouse emotion (pity, fear, anger, and the like), orto maximize or minimize things. It is clear, also, that their mentalprocedure must be on the same lines in their actions likewise, wheneverthey wish them to arouse pity or horror, or have a look of importance orprobability. The only difference is that with the act the impression hasto be made without explanation; whereas with the spoken word it has tobe produced by the speaker, and result from his language. What, indeed,would be the good of the speaker, if things appeared in the requiredlight even apart from anything he says?As regards the Diction, one subject for inquiry under this head is theturns given to the language when spoken; e.g. the difference betweencommand and prayer, simple statement and threat, question and answer,and so forth. The theory of such matters, however, belongs to Elocutionand the professors of that art. Whether the poet knows these things ornot, his art as a poet is never seriously criticized on that account.What fault can one see in Homer's 'Sing of the wrath, Goddess'?--whichProtagoras has criticized as being a command where a prayer was meant,since to bid one do or not do, he tells us, is a command. Let us passover this, then, as appertaining to another art, and not to that ofpoetry.20The Diction viewed as a whole is made up of the following parts:the Letter (or ultimate element), the Syllable, the Conjunction, theArticle, the Noun, the Verb, the Case, and the Speech. (1) The Letter isan indivisible sound of a particular kind, one that may become a factorin an intelligible sound. Indivisible sounds are uttered by the brutesalso, but no one of these is a Letter in our sense of the term. Theseelementary sounds are either vowels, semivowels, or mutes. A vowel is aLetter having an audible sound without the addition of another Letter.A semivowel, one having an audible sound by the addition of anotherLetter; e.g. S and R. A mute, one having no sound at all by itself, butbecoming audible by an addition, that of one of the Letters which havea sound of some sort of their own; e.g. D and G. The Letters differ invarious ways: as produced by different conformations or in differentregions of the mouth; as aspirated, not aspirated, or sometimes oneand sometimes the other; as long, short, or of variable quantity; andfurther as having an acute grave, or intermediate accent.The details of these matters we must leave to the metricians. (2) ASyllable is a nonsignificant composite sound, made up of a mute and aLetter having a sound (a vowel or semivowel); for GR, without an A,is just as much a Syllable as GRA, with an A. The various forms of theSyllable also belong to the theory of metre. (3) A Conjunction is (a) anon-significant sound which, when one significant sound is formable outof several, neither hinders nor aids the union, and which, if the Speechthus formed stands by itself (apart from other Speeches) must not beinserted at the beginning of it; e.g. _men_, _de_, _toi_, _de_. Or (b)a non-significant sound capable of combining two or more significantsounds into one; e.g. _amphi_, _peri_, etc. (4) An Article is anon-significant sound marking the beginning, end, or dividing-point ofa Speech, its natural place being either at the extremities or inthe middle. (5) A Noun or name is a composite significant sound notinvolving the idea of time, with parts which have no significance bythemselves in it. It is to be remembered that in a compound we do notthink of the parts as having a significance also by themselves; in thename 'Theodorus', for instance, the _doron_ means nothing to us.(6) A Verb is a composite significant sound involving the idea oftime, with parts which (just as in the Noun) have no significance bythemselves in it. Whereas the word 'man' or 'white' does not imply_when_, 'walks' and 'has walked' involve in addition to the idea ofwalking that of time present or time past.(7) A Case of a Noun or Verb is when the word means 'of or 'to' a thing,and so forth, or for one or many (e.g. 'man' and 'men'); or it mayconsist merely in the mode of utterance, e.g. in question, command, etc.'Walked?' and 'Walk!' are Cases of the verb 'to walk' of this last kind.(8) A Speech is a composite significant sound, some of the parts ofwhich have a certain significance by themselves. It may be observed thata Speech is not always made up of Noun and Verb; it may be without aVerb, like the definition of man; but it will always have some part witha certain significance by itself. In the Speech 'Cleon walks', 'Cleon'is an instance of such a part. A Speech is said to be one in two ways,either as signifying one thing, or as a union of several Speeches madeinto one by conjunction. Thus the _Iliad_ is one Speech by conjunctionof several; and the definition of man is one through its signifying onething.21Nouns are of two kinds, either (1) simple, i.e. made up ofnon-significant parts, like the word ge, or (2) double; in thelatter case the word may be made up either of a significant and anon-significant part (a distinction which disappears in the compound),or of two significant parts. It is possible also to have triple,quadruple or higher compounds, like most of our amplified names; e.g.'Hermocaicoxanthus' and the like.Whatever its structure, a Noun must always be either (1) the ordinaryword for the thing, or (2) a strange word, or (3) a metaphor, or (4) anornamental word, or (5) a coined word, or (6) a word lengthened out, or(7) curtailed, or (8) altered in form. By the ordinary word I meanthat in general use in a country; and by a strange word, one in useelsewhere. So that the same word may obviously be at once strange andordinary, though not in reference to the same people; _sigunos_, forinstance, is an ordinary word in Cyprus, and a strange word with us.Metaphor consists in giving the thing a name that belongs to somethingelse; the transference being either from genus to species, or fromspecies to genus, or from species to species, or on grounds of analogy.That from genus to species is eXemplified in 'Here stands my ship'; forlying at anchor is the 'standing' of a particular kind of thing. Thatfrom species to genus in 'Truly ten thousand good deeds has Ulysseswrought', where 'ten thousand', which is a particular large number,is put in place of the generic 'a large number'. That from species tospecies in 'Drawing the life with the bronze', and in 'Severing with theenduring bronze'; where the poet uses 'draw' in the sense of 'sever' and'sever' in that of 'draw', both words meaning to 'take away' something.That from analogy is possible whenever there are four terms so relatedthat the second (B) is to the first (A), as the fourth (D) to the third(C); for one may then metaphorically put B in lieu of D, and D in lieuof B. Now and then, too, they qualify the metaphor by adding on to itthat to which the word it supplants is relative. Thus a cup (B) isin relation to Dionysus (A) what a shield (D) is to Ares (C). Thecup accordingly will be metaphorically described as the 'shield _ofDionysus_' (D + A), and the shield as the 'cup _of Ares_' (B + C). Or totake another instance: As old age (D) is to life (C), so is evening (B)to day (A). One will accordingly describe evening (B) as the 'old age_of the day_' (D + A)--or by the Empedoclean equivalent; and old age (D)as the 'evening' or 'sunset of life'' (B + C). It may be that some ofthe terms thus related have no special name of their own, but for allthat they will be metaphorically described in just the same way. Thus tocast forth seed-corn is called 'sowing'; but to cast forth its flame,as said of the sun, has no special name. This nameless act (B), however,stands in just the same relation to its object, sunlight (A), as sowing(D) to the seed-corn (C). Hence the expression in the poet, 'sowingaround a god-created _flame_' (D + A). There is also another form ofqualified metaphor. Having given the thing the alien name, one may by anegative addition deny of it one of the attributes naturally associatedwith its new name. An instance of this would be to call the shield notthe 'cup _of Ares_,' as in the former case, but a 'cup _that holds nowine_'. * * * A coined word is a name which, being quite unknown amonga people, is given by the poet himself; e.g. (for there are some wordsthat seem to be of this origin) _hernyges_ for horns, and _areter_ forpriest. A word is said to be lengthened out, when it has a short vowelmade long, or an extra syllable inserted; e. g. _polleos_ for _poleos_,_Peleiadeo_ for _Peleidon_. It is said to be curtailed, when it has losta part; e.g. _kri_, _do_, and _ops_ in _mia ginetai amphoteron ops_.It is an altered word, when part is left as it was and part is of thepoet's making; e.g. _dexiteron_ for _dexion_, in _dexiteron kata maxon_.The Nouns themselves (to whatever class they may belong) are eithermasculines, feminines, or intermediates (neuter). All ending in N, P,S, or in the two compounds of this last, PS and X, are masculines. Allending in the invariably long vowels, H and O, and in A among the vowelsthat may be long, are feminines. So that there is an equal number ofmasculine and feminine terminations, as PS and X are the same as S,and need not be counted. There is no Noun, however, ending in a muteor in either of the two short vowels, E and O. Only three (_meli, kommi,peperi_) end in I, and five in T. The intermediates, or neuters, end inthe variable vowels or in N, P, X.22The perfection of Diction is for it to be at once clear and not mean.The clearest indeed is that made up of the ordinary words for things,but it is mean, as is shown by the poetry of Cleophon and Sthenelus. Onthe other hand the Diction becomes distinguished and non-prosaic bythe use of unfamiliar terms, i.e. strange words, metaphors, lengthenedforms, and everything that deviates from the ordinary modes ofspeech.--But a whole statement in such terms will be either a riddle ora barbarism, a riddle, if made up of metaphors, a barbarism, if madeup of strange words. The very nature indeed of a riddle is this, todescribe a fact in an impossible combination of words (which cannot bedone with the real names for things, but can be with their metaphoricalsubstitutes); e.g. 'I saw a man glue brass on another with fire',and the like. The corresponding use of strange words results in abarbarism.--A certain admixture, accordingly, of unfamiliar termsis necessary. These, the strange word, the metaphor, the ornamentalequivalent, etc.. will save the language from seeming mean and prosaic,while the ordinary words in it will secure the requisite clearness. Whathelps most, however, to render the Diction at once clear and non-prosaicis the use of the lengthened, curtailed, and altered forms of words.Their deviation from the ordinary words will, by making the languageunlike that in general use give it a non-prosaic appearance; and theirhaving much in common with the words in general use will give it thequality of clearness. It is not right, then, to condemn these modes ofspeech, and ridicule the poet for using them, as some have done; e.g.the elder Euclid, who said it was easy to make poetry if one were tobe allowed to lengthen the words in the statement itself as much asone likes--a procedure he caricatured by reading '_Epixarhon eidonMarathonade Badi--gonta_, and _ouk han g' eramenos ton ekeinou helleboron_ as verses. A too apparent use of these licences has certainly aludicrous effect, but they are not alone in that; the rule of moderationapplies to all the constituents of the poetic vocabulary; even withmetaphors, strange words, and the rest, the effect will be the same,if one uses them improperly and with a view to provoking laughter. Theproper use of them is a very different thing. To realize the differenceone should take an epic verse and see how it reads when the normal wordsare introduced. The same should be done too with the strange word, themetaphor, and the rest; for one has only to put the ordinary words intheir place to see the truth of what we are saying. The same iambic, forinstance, is found in Aeschylus and Euripides, and as it stands in theformer it is a poor line; whereas Euripides, by the change of a singleword, the substitution of a strange for what is by usage the ordinaryword, has made it seem a fine one. Aeschylus having said in his_Philoctetes_: _phagedaina he mon sarkas hesthiei podos_Euripides has merely altered the hesthiei here into thoinatai. Orsuppose _nun de m' heon holigos te kai outidanos kai haeikos_to be altered by the substitution of the ordinary words into _nun de m' heon mikros te kai hasthenikos kai haeidos_Or the line _diphron haeikelion katatheis olingen te trapexan_into _diphron moxtheron katatheis mikran te trapexan_Or heiones boosin into heiones kraxousin. Add to this that Ariphradesused to ridicule the tragedians for introducing expressions unknownin the language of common life, _doeaton hapo_ (for _apo domaton_),_sethen_, _hego de nin_, _Achilleos peri_ (for _peri Achilleos_), andthe like. The mere fact of their not being in ordinary speech gives theDiction a non-prosaic character; but Ariphrades was unaware of that. Itis a great thing, indeed, to make a proper use of these poetical forms,as also of compounds and strange words. But the greatest thing by faris to be a master of metaphor. It is the one thing that cannot be learntfrom others; and it is also a sign of genius, since a good metaphorimplies an intuitive perception of the similarity in dissimilars.Of the kinds of words we have enumerated it may be observed thatcompounds are most in place in the dithyramb, strange words in heroic,and metaphors in iambic poetry. Heroic poetry, indeed, may avail itselfof them all. But in iambic verse, which models itself as far as possibleon the spoken language, only those kinds of words are in place which areallowable also in an oration, i.e. the ordinary word, the metaphor, andthe ornamental equivalent.Let this, then, suffice as an account of Tragedy, the art imitating bymeans of action on the stage.23As for the poetry which merely narrates, or imitates by means ofversified language (without action), it is evident that it has severalpoints in common with Tragedy.I. The construction of its stories should clearly be like that in adrama; they should be based on a single action, one that is a completewhole in itself, with a beginning, middle, and end, so as to enable thework to produce its own proper pleasure with all the organic unity of aliving creature. Nor should one suppose that there is anything like themin our usual histories. A history has to deal not with one action, butwith one period and all that happened in that to one or more persons,however disconnected the several events may have been. Just as twoevents may take place at the same time, e.g. the sea-fight off Salamisand the battle with the Carthaginians in Sicily, without converging tothe same end, so too of two consecutive events one may sometimes comeafter the other with no one end as their common issue. Nevertheless mostof our epic poets, one may say, ignore the distinction.Herein, then, to repeat what we have said before, we have a furtherproof of Homer's marvellous superiority to the rest. He did not attemptto deal even with the Trojan war in its entirety, though it was a wholewith a definite beginning and end--through a feeling apparently thatit was too long a story to be taken in in one view, or if not that, toocomplicated from the variety of incident in it. As it is, he has singledout one section of the whole; many of the other incidents, however, hebrings in as episodes, using the Catalogue of the Ships, for instance,and other episodes to relieve the uniformity of his narrative. As forthe other epic poets, they treat of one man, or one period; or else ofan action which, although one, has a multiplicity of parts in it. Thislast is what the authors of the _Cypria_ and _Little_ _Iliad_ havedone. And the result is that, whereas the _Iliad_ or _Odyssey_ suppliesmaterials for only one, or at most two tragedies, the _Cypria_ doesthat for several, and the _Little_ _Iliad_ for more than eight: for an_Adjudgment of Arms_, a _Philoctetes_, a _Neoptolemus_, a _Eurypylus_,a _Ulysses as Beggar_, a _Laconian Women_, a _Fall of Ilium_, and a_Departure of the Fleet_; as also a _Sinon_, and _Women of Troy_.24II. Besides this, Epic poetry must divide into the same species asTragedy; it must be either simple or complex, a story of characteror one of suffering. Its parts, too, with the exception of Song andSpectacle, must be the same, as it requires Peripeties, Discoveries, andscenes of suffering just like Tragedy. Lastly, the Thought and Dictionin it must be good in their way. All these elements appear in Homerfirst; and he has made due use of them. His two poems are each examplesof construction, the _Iliad_ simple and a story of suffering, the_Odyssey_ complex (there is Discovery throughout it) and a story ofcharacter. And they are more than this, since in Diction and Thought toothey surpass all other poems.There is, however, a difference in the Epic as compared with Tragedy,(1) in its length, and (2) in its metre. (1) As to its length, the limitalready suggested will suffice: it must be possible for the beginningand end of the work to be taken in in one view--a condition which willbe fulfilled if the poem be shorter than the old epics, and aboutas long as the series of tragedies offered for one hearing. For theextension of its length epic poetry has a special advantage, of which itmakes large use. In a play one cannot represent an action with a numberof parts going on simultaneously; one is limited to the part on thestage and connected with the actors. Whereas in epic poetry the narrativeform makes it possible for one to describe a number of simultaneousincidents; and these, if germane to the subject, increase the body ofthe poem. This then is a gain to the Epic, tending to give it grandeur,and also variety of interest and room for episodes of diverse kinds.Uniformity of incident by the satiety it soon creates is apt to ruintragedies on the stage. (2) As for its metre, the heroic has beenassigned it from experience; were any one to attempt a narrative poemin some one, or in several, of the other metres, the incongruity ofthe thing would be apparent. The heroic; in fact is the gravest andweightiest of metres--which is what makes it more tolerant than the restof strange words and metaphors, that also being a point in whichthe narrative form of poetry goes beyond all others. The iambicand trochaic, on the other hand, are metres of movement, the onerepresenting that of life and action, the other that of the dance. Stillmore unnatural would it appear, it one were to write an epic in a medleyof metres, as Chaeremon did. Hence it is that no one has ever writtena long story in any but heroic verse; nature herself, as we have said,teaches us to select the metre appropriate to such a story.Homer, admirable as he is in every other respect, is especially so inthis, that he alone among epic poets is not unaware of the part to beplayed by the poet himself in the poem. The poet should say very littlein propria persona, as he is no imitator when doing that. Whereasthe other poets are perpetually coming forward in person, and say butlittle, and that only here and there, as imitators, Homer after a briefpreface brings in forthwith a man, a woman, or some other Character--noone of them characterless, but each with distinctive characteristics.The marvellous is certainly required in Tragedy. The Epic, however,affords more opening for the improbable, the chief factor in themarvellous, because in it the agents are not visibly before one. Thescene of the pursuit of Hector would be ridiculous on the stage--theGreeks halting instead of pursuing him, and Achilles shaking his head tostop them; but in the poem the absurdity is overlooked. The marvellous,however, is a cause of pleasure, as is shown by the fact that we alltell a story with additions, in the belief that we are doing our hearersa pleasure.Homer more than any other has taught the rest of us the art of framinglies in the right way. I mean the use of paralogism. Whenever, if A isor happens, a consequent, B, is or happens, men's notion is that, if theB is, the A also is--but that is a false conclusion. Accordingly, if Ais untrue, but there is something else, B, that on the assumption of itstruth follows as its consequent, the right thing then is to add on theB. Just because we know the truth of the consequent, we are in our ownminds led on to the erroneous inference of the truth of the antecedent.Here is an instance, from the Bath-story in the _Odyssey_.A likely impossibility is always preferable to an unconvincingpossibility. The story should never be made up of improbable incidents;there should be nothing of the sort in it. If, however, such incidentsare unavoidable, they should be outside the piece, like the hero'signorance in _Oedipus_ of the circumstances of Lams' death; not withinit, like the report of the Pythian games in _Electra_, or the man'shaving come to Mysia from Tegea without uttering a word on the way, in_The Mysians_. So that it is ridiculous to say that one's Plot wouldhave been spoilt without them, since it is fundamentally wrong to makeup such Plots. If the poet has taken such a Plot, however, and onesees that he might have put it in a more probable form, he is guiltyof absurdity as well as a fault of art. Even in the _Odyssey_ theimprobabilities in the setting-ashore of Ulysses would be clearlyintolerable in the hands of an inferior poet. As it is, the poetconceals them, his other excellences veiling their absurdity. ElaborateDiction, however, is required only in places where there is no action,and no Character or Thought to be revealed. Where there is Characteror Thought, on the other hand, an over-ornate Diction tends to obscurethem.25As regards Problems and their Solutions, one may see the number andnature of the assumptions on which they proceed by viewing the matter inthe following way. (1) The poet being an imitator just like the painteror other maker of likenesses, he must necessarily in all instancesrepresent things in one or other of three aspects, either as they wereor are, or as they are said or thought to be or to have been, or as theyought to be. (2) All this he does in language, with an admixture, itmay be, of strange words and metaphors, as also of the various modifiedforms of words, since the use of these is conceded in poetry. (3) It isto be remembered, too, that there is not the same kind of correctnessin poetry as in politics, or indeed any other art. There is, however,within the limits of poetry itself a possibility of two kinds of error,the one directly, the other only accidentally connected with the art. Ifthe poet meant to describe the thing correctly, and failed throughlack of power of expression, his art itself is at fault. But if it wasthrough his having meant to describe it in some incorrect way (e.g. tomake the horse in movement have both right legs thrown forward) that thetechnical error (one in a matter of, say, medicine or some other specialscience), or impossibilities of whatever kind they may be, have got intohis description, his error in that case is not in the essentials of thepoetic art. These, therefore, must be the premisses of the Solutions inanswer to the criticisms involved in the Problems.I. As to the criticisms relating to the poet's art itself. Anyimpossibilities there may be in his descriptions of things are faults.But from another point of view they are justifiable, if they serve theend of poetry itself--if (to assume what we have said of that end) theymake the effect of some portion of the work more astounding. The Pursuitof Hector is an instance in point. If, however, the poetic end mighthave been as well or better attained without sacrifice of technicalcorrectness in such matters, the impossibility is not to be justified,since the description should be, if it can, entirely free from error.One may ask, too, whether the error is in a matter directly or onlyaccidentally connected with the poetic art; since it is a lesser errorin an artist not to know, for instance, that the hind has no horns, thanto produce an unrecognizable picture of one.II. If the poet's description be criticized as not true to fact, one mayurge perhaps that the object ought to be as described--an answer likethat of Sophocles, who said that he drew men as they ought to be, andEuripides as they were. If the description, however, be neither true norof the thing as it ought to be, the answer must be then, that it is inaccordance with opinion. The tales about Gods, for instance, may be aswrong as Xenophanes thinks, neither true nor the better thing to say;but they are certainly in accordance with opinion. Of other statementsin poetry one may perhaps say, not that they are better than the truth,but that the fact was so at the time; e.g. the description of the arms:'their spears stood upright, butt-end upon the ground'; for that was theusual way of fixing them then, as it is still with the Illyrians. As forthe question whether something said or done in a poem is morally rightor not, in dealing with that one should consider not only the intrinsicquality of the actual word or deed, but also the person who says or doesit, the person to whom he says or does it, the time, the means, and themotive of the agent--whether he does it to attain a greater good, or toavoid a greater evil.III. Other criticisms one must meet by considering the language of thepoet: (1) by the assumption of a strange word in a passage like _oureasmen proton_, where by _oureas_ Homer may perhaps mean not mules butsentinels. And in saying of Dolon, _hos p e toi eidos men heen kakos_,his meaning may perhaps be, not that Dolon's body was deformed, but thathis face was ugly, as _eneidos_ is the Cretan word for handsome-faced.So, too, _goroteron de keraie_ may mean not 'mix the wine stronger', asthough for topers, but 'mix it quicker'. (2) Other expressions in Homermay be explained as metaphorical; e.g. in _halloi men ra theoi te kaianeres eudon (hapantes) pannux_ as compared with what he tells us at thesame time, _e toi hot hes pedion to Troikon hathreseien, aulon suriggon*te homadon*_ the word _hapantes_ 'all', is metaphorically put for'many', since 'all' is a species of 'many '. So also his _oie d'ammoros_ is metaphorical, the best known standing 'alone'. (3) A change,as Hippias suggested, in the mode of reading a word will solve thedifficulty in _didomen de oi_, and _to men ou kataputhetai hombro_.(4) Other difficulties may be solved by another punctuation; e.g. inEmpedocles, _aipsa de thnet ephyonto, ta prin mathon athanata xora teprin kekreto_. Or (5) by the assumption of an equivocal term, as in_parocheken de pleo nux_, where _pleo_ in equivocal. Or (6) by an appealto the custom of language. Wine-and-water we call 'wine'; and it ison the same principle that Homer speaks of a _knemis neoteuktoukassiteroio_, a 'greave of new-wrought tin.' A worker in iron we call a'brazier'; and it is on the same principle that Ganymede is describedas the 'wine-server' of Zeus, though the Gods do not drink wine. Thislatter, however, may be an instance of metaphor. But whenever also aword seems to imply some contradiction, it is necessary to reflect howmany ways there may be of understanding it in the passage in question;e.g. in Homer's _te r' hesxeto xalkeon hegxos_ one should consider thepossible senses of 'was stopped there'--whether by taking it in thissense or in that one will best avoid the fault of which Glaucon speaks:'They start with some improbable presumption; and having so decreed itthemselves, proceed to draw inferences, and censure the poet as thoughhe had actually said whatever they happen to believe, if his statementconflicts with their own notion of things.' This is how Homer's silenceabout Icarius has been treated. Starting with, the notion of his havingbeen a Lacedaemonian, the critics think it strange for Telemachus not tohave met him when he went to Lacedaemon. Whereas the fact may have beenas the Cephallenians say, that the wife of Ulysses was of a Cephallenianfamily, and that her father's name was Icadius, not Icarius. So that itis probably a mistake of the critics that has given rise to the Problem.Speaking generally, one has to justify (1) the Impossible by referenceto the requirements of poetry, or to the better, or to opinion. Forthe purposes of poetry a convincing impossibility is preferable toan unconvincing possibility; and if men such as Zeuxis depicted beimpossible, the answer is that it is better they should be like that, asthe artist ought to improve on his model. (2) The Improbable one hasto justify either by showing it to be in accordance with opinion, or byurging that at times it is not improbable; for there is a probability ofthings happening also against probability. (3) The contradictions foundin the poet's language one should first test as one does an opponent'sconfutation in a dialectical argument, so as to see whether he meansthe same thing, in the same relation, and in the same sense, beforeadmitting that he has contradicted either something he has said himselfor what a man of sound sense assumes as true. But there is no possibleapology for improbability of Plot or depravity of character, when theyare not necessary and no use is made of them, like the improbabilityin the appearance of Aegeus in _Medea_ and the baseness of Menelaus in_Orestes_.The objections, then, of critics start with faults of five kinds:the allegation is always that something in either (1) impossible, (2)improbable, (3) corrupting, (4) contradictory, or (5) against technicalcorrectness. The answers to these objections must be sought under one orother of the above-mentioned heads, which are twelve in number.26The question may be raised whether the epic or the tragic is the higherform of imitation. It may be argued that, if the less vulgar is thehigher, and the less vulgar is always that which addresses the betterpublic, an art addressing any and every one is of a very vulgar order.It is a belief that their public cannot see the meaning, unless theyadd something themselves, that causes the perpetual movements ofthe performers--bad flute-players, for instance, rolling about, ifquoit-throwing is to be represented, and pulling at the conductor, ifScylla is the subject of the piece. Tragedy, then, is said to be an artof this order--to be in fact just what the later actors were in the eyesof their predecessors; for Myrmiscus used to call Callippides 'the ape',because he thought he so overacted his parts; and a similar view wastaken of Pindarus also. All Tragedy, however, is said to stand to theEpic as the newer to the older school of actors. The one, accordingly,is said to address a cultivated 'audience, which does not need theaccompaniment of gesture; the other, an uncultivated one. If, therefore,Tragedy is a vulgar art, it must clearly be lower than the Epic.The answer to this is twofold. In the first place, one may urge (1) thatthe censure does not touch the art of the dramatic poet, but only thatof his interpreter; for it is quite possible to overdo the gesturingeven in an epic recital, as did Sosistratus, and in a singing contest,as did Mnasitheus of Opus. (2) That one should not condemn all movement,unless one means to condemn even the dance, but only that of ignoblepeople--which is the point of the criticism passed on Callippides andin the present day on others, that their women are not like gentlewomen.(3) That Tragedy may produce its effect even without movement or actionin just the same way as Epic poetry; for from the mere reading of aplay its quality may be seen. So that, if it be superior in all otherrespects, this element of inferiority is not a necessary part of it.In the second place, one must remember (1) that Tragedy has everythingthat the Epic has (even the epic metre being admissible), together witha not inconsiderable addition in the shape of the Music (a very realfactor in the pleasure of the drama) and the Spectacle. (2) That itsreality of presentation is felt in the play as read, as well as in theplay as acted. (3) That the tragic imitation requires less space forthe attainment of its end; which is a great advantage, since the moreconcentrated effect is more pleasurable than one with a large admixtureof time to dilute it--consider the _Oedipus_ of Sophocles, for instance,and the effect of expanding it into the number of lines of the _Iliad_.(4) That there is less unity in the imitation of the epic poets, asis proved by the fact that any one work of theirs supplies matter forseveral tragedies; the result being that, if they take what is reallya single story, it seems curt when briefly told, and thin and waterishwhen on the scale of length usual with their verse. In saying thatthere is less unity in an epic, I mean an epic made up of a pluralityof actions, in the same way as the _Iliad_ and _Odyssey_ have many suchparts, each one of them in itself of some magnitude; yet the structureof the two Homeric poems is as perfect as can be, and the action in themis as nearly as possible one action. If, then, Tragedy is superior inthese respects, and also besides these, in its poetic effect (since thetwo forms of poetry should give us, not any or every pleasure, but thevery special kind we have mentioned), it is clear that, as attaining thepoetic effect better than the Epic, it will be the higher form of art.So much for Tragedy and Epic poetry--for these two arts in general andtheir species; the number and nature of their constituent parts; thecauses of success and failure in them; the Objections of the critics,and the Solutions in answer to them."]
